AB  - This Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a medical condition that affects women of reproductive age, characterized by a hormonal imbalance. It usually starts during adolescence, but symptoms may fluctuate over time. PCOS can cause hormonal imbalances due to the cysts present in the ovaries and that can lead to secretion of excess level of androgen. Due to this a PCOS patient can have irregular periods which can cause infertility due to the lack of ovulation. One of the major cause of infertility is PCOS. PCOS is a condition where it is incurable. However, through lifestyle changes, medications and fertility treatments some symptoms can be controlled. Factors like genetics, obesity and high level of androgen can be the causes of the PCOS. But the exact cause is unknown. Polycyst detection using ovarian ultrasonography (USG) scans is a very reliable way to accurately diagnose PCOS and create individualized treatment plans for affected people. Adopting an intelligent computer-assisted cyst detection method is a workable alternative to depending on the imperfect process of manual identification. Thus, we introduced a deep learning-based classification system for PCOS prediction in this research. We train and test the model with a dataset of ovarian ultrasonography (USG) images. To distinguish between ovaries affected by PCOS and those that are not, relevant features from the dataset were specifically extracted using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This paper compares different deep learning algorithms such as Alexnet, Resnet50, VGG16 and YOLO V5, which have been found to be the most useful in classifying the ovaries affected by PCOS effectively. The validation techniques show Yolo V5 to be the most effective with an accuracy of 99.8%.

AB  - Liver dysfunction is most commonly brought on by fatty liver disease, which is widespread in both developed and developing countries. If not addressed, fatty liver might lead to serious complications. As juvenile obesity rates rise, so does the number of children diagnosed with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In order to distinguish nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from healthy liver tissue, we wanted to perform digital image analysis (DIA) on ultrasound (US) pictures of the liver and create a machine learning (ML) based categorization model. This study compares EfficientNet Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for its ability to detect the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in ultrasound images. The histological outcome of a liver biopsy may have been consulted as a reference for liver fat, as well as ultrasound scans of persons who went through laparoscopic surgery were additionally utilized as a reference for liver fat. EfficientNet Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors were then used to classify the photos into one of two categories. For EfficientNet categorization, an artificial model for predicting liver fat from ultrasound images achieved an accuracy of 87%. However, when using K-Nearest Neighbors for categorization, 85% accuracies were achieved. Automatic detection of liver fat utilizing the suggested technique based on textural characteristics utilizing the GLCM and the EfficientNet categorization from ultrasound pictures can aid physicians and radiologists in making a definitive diagnosis.

AB  - Recent study reveals that the mortality rate due to chronic diseases like heart disease is increasing year on year. Predicting heart disease at an early stage is posing a challenge to the healthcare industry due to multiple contributory factors like high blood pressure, uncontrolled cholesterol, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, alcohol consumption, etc. An accurate and effective diagnosis of heart disease at an early stage can prevent fatal complications such as heart attacks and strokes significantly. This research will not only help the medical fraternity, medico research scientists, and insurance agencies to assess the probability of heart disease but also help the common man to prevent hospitalization and reduce the expenses for the diagnosis significantly. In the past, multiple studies have been conducted on heart disease prediction using regular human vital parameters. We have expanded the research with family hereditary data of the person and by effectively using this feature we have evaluated model performance changes. We have used machine learning classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree along with ensemble techniques like Random Forest with boosting algorithms like Ada Boost, XG Boost, etc. We evaluated the model performance with various metrics like precision, F1-score, and recall with more importance to the accuracy of the prediction.

AB  - Diabetes is one of the most devastating diseases and affects many people. Diabetes can be caused by a variety of causes, including ageing, obesity, inactivity, genetics, a poor diet, high blood pressure, and others. Diabetes increases the likelihood of developing several illnesses, including heart disease, renal disease, stroke, eye problems, nerve damage, etc. The information needed to diagnose diabetes is currently gathered through a variety of tests used in hospitals, and the diagnosis is then used to determine the best course of treatment. The healthcare sector has a considerable application for machine learning (ML). Databases in the healthcare sector are very vast. Big datasets can be examined using ML techniques to find hidden information and patterns, allowing one to learn from the data and predict outcomes properly. Using the existing methods, the forecast’s accuracy is not very good. In this study, we proposed an early diabetes prediction model that incorporates several extrinsic characteristics that contribute to the development of diabetes together with more widely used measures like polyuria, weight loss, polyphagia, visual blurring, alopecia, obesity, etc. The Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Logistic Regression (LOR), the Boosted Tree (BOT), and the Bagged Tree (BAT) are four different classifiers that are utilized in this paper to predict diabetes early on. The device’s performance is assessed in terms of accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and f-measure. Results show that among the classifiers, BAT has the highest accuracy, at 98%.

AB  - Diabetes is a critical condition that affects a large number of people. It can be caused by age, obesity, lack of exercise, genetic diabetes, lifestyle, poor diet, high blood pressure, and other factors. People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, eye problems, nerve damage, and more. The current practice of the hospital is to gather the necessary information for the diagnosis of diabetes using various tests, and then to provide appropriate treatment according to the diagnosis. Big Data Analytics is important in the healthcare industry. Data stored in the healthcare industry is huge in size. By using large data statistics, one can scan large data sets to reveal hidden information and trends, enabling one to obtain data and predictably produce results accordingly. The classification and prediction accuracy of the current method is not very good. In this study, we present a predictive model of diabetes for advanced diabetes classification that includes a few external variables that cause diabetes in addition to normal components such as glucose, BMI, age, insulin, and so on. Compared to the old database, the new database improves the accuracy of categories. In addition, a diabetic pipeline model was developed for the purpose of improving the accuracy of the sections.

AB  - The global obesity epidemic has persisted for many years, resulting from prevalent dietary disorders that expose individuals to a multitude of health risks. Juggling the demands of a working adult’s life while trying to manage one’s diet can prove to be quite a challenge. Machine Learning (ML) stands as an incredibly potent and indispensable technology in our contemporary world.The system will have a significant emphasis on calorie and nutrient calculation within food items, and it sets itself apart from existing systems by offering full automation, eliminating the need for users to manually input data. Users will find the process incredibly straightforward, merely requiring them to capture an image of their food and provide it as input to the system. The initial phase of the system involves determining an individual’s recommended calorie intake based on their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This calculated daily calorie goal is then continually monitored and presented through Augmented Reality (AR). If the individual successfully adheres to their daily calorie target, the system sends an achievement notification to acknowledge their progress. However, should the individual surpass their calorie goal, the system responds by displaying a pop-up AR window suggesting suitable exercises to help offset the excess calorie consumption. This approach combines personalized calorie management with real-time AR feedback to support users in maintaining their desired dietary goals and overall health.

AB  - Obesity, a complex condition involving genetic, behavioral, socioeconomic, and environmental factors, poses significant health risks and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for individuals with severe obesity, resulting in substantial weight loss. However, weight regain remains a significant challenge in the long-term after surgery. This study focuses on analyzing movement patterns of patients who have undergone bariatric surgery using wearable accelerometry to investigate the relationships between movement behaviors, body composition, and weight regain. An intelligent system employing machine learning techniques was utilized to predict total fat percentage and visceral fat. Results indicate that Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Gradient Boosting models show promising performance in predicting fat percentage and visceral fat. Furthermore, the study reveals associations between age, sedentary behavior, post-surgery BMI, day-and night-time movement, and body composition following bariatric surgery. These findings contribute to a better understanding of factors influencing weight regain and may inform future interventions to promote long-term weight loss maintenance in bariatric surgery patients.

AB  - Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are proven to be widespread in the population, often resulting in mortality. As per recent reports, the dramatic rise in heart attacks and cardiovascular illnesses is attributed, in part, to post-COVID symptoms, obesity, lifestyle changes brought on by the pandemic, and intense work pressure coupled with stress and hypertension. Early identification is the key to lowering the rising mortality rates from CVD. However, with limited medical facilities and lack of specialized doctors, it is difficult to continuously monitor the patients and provide consultations. At the same time, the amount of data acquired by the medical industry is so vast that it might be difficult to observe and interpret at times. Using the same data to train a machine learning algorithm, a prediction model can be developed. Such a prediction system can be effective for both doctors and patients. This research studies the different cardiovascular diseases and the risk factors. This investigates some of the most extensively used machine learning algorithms for predicting heart disease utilizing medical data and historical information. In this article, we have compared primary machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression and SVM

AB  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a major health concern amongst a majority of women. Many issues, including infertility, acne, hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles, and obesity, may result from it. It could also result in type 2 diabetes, endometrial cancer, heart problems, and high blood pressure. Early diagnosis of PCOS may help prevent and treat such health concerns. This paper proposes using ultrasound imaging of the follicles to extract vital details about the ovary, such as the kind of cyst, the variety of follicles present, and how the size of the follicle reacts to hormonal imbalance. Using image processing techniques, morphological operations, and machine learning, the models identify the valuable characteristics in the ultrasound pictures, highlight them, and then build a suitable classification model for the same. On using transfer learning models such as VGG-16 and Inception-V3, an accuracy of 100% each is obtained.

Through data mining and the archiving of medical records, improved patient management is now possible thanks to the fusion of technology and medical diagnoses. Understanding the interaction between risk factors in the histories of patients and their impact on their prospects for heart disease is of utmost importance. This study aims to accurately predict cardiac disease by analyzing various data elements from patients. The selection and feature extraction methods are the most efficient choices for prediction system for heart disease. The following variables, such as age, sex, occupation, smoking, obesity, diet, exercise, mental stress levels, type of chest pain, history of chest pain, pressure, ECG, and results, have all been identified as significant factors in diagnosing heart disease. Various machine learning methods, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes (NB), K-nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were utilized to analyze the heart disease dataset. These datasets consisted of one with all features and another with only selected features. The objective was to compare the performance of these methods and determine which ones yielded accurate predictions. The results revealed that random forest, using the chosen features, outperformed other artificial intelligence algorithms, including those using all input features, achieving a maximum accuracy rate of 90%. As a support framework for predicting cardiac disease in its early stages, the suggested approach shows promise. This study advances the prognosis of cardiac disease, enables prompt therapies, and enhances patient outcomes by fusing the strength of data-driven AI algorithms with thorough feature selection.

AB  - Obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and depression have all been linked to insufficient sleep. Analysis of one's sleep habits using one's smartphone has gained popularity as a possible solution. In this paper, we provide a framework for analyzing sleep habits using mobile devices. Because of their widespread availability and extensive sensor suite, cellphones are being use in sleep research. Motion and orientation sensors and audio recorders are used in sleep analysis. Both head and body motions are tracked by the gyroscope and accelerometer, respectively. The microphone is sensitive enough to pick up noises like snoring. Approaches to sleep analysis on smartphones range widely. Sensor data may be analyzed using machine learning algorithms. These systems can distinguish between light, deep, and REM sleep by analyzing data from motion and sound sensors. Gather information about your sleep using surveys or questionnaires like the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Analysis of sleep patterns with a mobile device has several benefits. It's a simple and non-invasive way to study how you sleep. Second, it offers continuous monitoring of sleep, which might lead to the identification and resolution of sleep disorders. Third, it may provide objective sleep data for the diagnosis of sleep disorders and the development of individualized treatment plans. Analysis of one's slumber using a smartphone might shed light on our sleeping habits and encourage healthy ones. Machine learning algorithms and questionnaires are two methods for analyzing sleep quality on a smartphone. Smartphone-based sleep studies are easy to implement and conduct, and they provide reliable, objective information on one's nightly slumber.

AB  - One of the most life-threatening diseases that causes human beings to suffer is heart disease. According to WHO report, more than 17.9 million people are affected and raised to death due to cardiovascular diseases around the globe. Many factors that influence the disease are high blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, etc. An earlier diagnosis of the disease helps to change the lifestyle and the start of treatment helps to save the human being life. Machine learning techniques are used in this work to analyze heart disease effectively. The purpose of the research is to perform efficient heart disease analysis using ML models. Machine learning is a sub-category of AI that makes decisions based on past and historical data. ML can be sub-classified into 3 types. In this research, supervised ML models are considered for analysis. In supervised ML models: K-NN, SVM, and RF are applied. The experimental approach is conducted with the heart disease dataset with three different ML models. The results demonstrate that the RF approach has the best performance across all metrics, subsequent to the SVM model and the KNN model. Among the three models, the RF model has the greatest sensitivity (0.8654), precision (0.8182), specificity (0.7674), and accuracy (0.82105) compared to other approaches in this particular heart disease dataset.

AB  - Breast cancer is one of the major causes of fatalities in women across the globe, necessitating early diagnosis and detection for successful treatment. Scientists have pinpointed numerous risk factors for breast cancer such as obesity and sex hormones. Machine learning prediction systems have employed diverse data types, like genetic profiles, clinical data, and X-ray images, to foresee the risk of breast cancer. To eliminate any unnecessary or superfluous attributes from high-dimensional datasets, algorithms for feature selection have been applied. This research proposes a composite machine learning model integrating five models: Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression with Lasso Regularization, Logistic Regression with Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Feature selection methodologies employed are based on the K-Means clustering oriented feature importance measure. The Coimbra breast cancer dataset, composed of 116 data points and 10 characteristics, is used for training and assessing the models on their predictive abilities. According to the study’s outcomes, the Support Vector Machine model demonstrates the greatest effectiveness for the dataset when used with the proposed feature selection, whereas Gradient Boosting and Random Forest are efficacious models without feature selection.

AB  - Chronic liver disease (CLD) stands as a formidable health challenge, casting a long shadow across global healthcare landscapes. Its progression, often silent until advanced stages, makes it a particularly perilous condition, leading to significant morbidity and mortality if left unchecked. The dangers of liver disease cannot be overstated, with its ability to disrupt the liver's essential functions, from filtering toxins to aiding in digestion. Awareness about liver health is crucial, as early detection can dramatically alter the course of the disease, offering pathways to management or even reversal of damage in some cases. In the United States, liver disease has become a significant health crisis, with alarming statistics highlighting the need for urgent attention. Liver disease accounts for thousands of deaths annually, with recent figures indicating a steady rise in liver-related mortality. Factors contributing to this trend include the prevalence of hepatitis C, alcohol-related liver disease, and the emerging epidemic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), driven by rising obesity rates. These statistics serve not just as numbers but as a clarion call for enhanced prevention, early detection, and treatment efforts to stem the tide of CLD. Advancements in machine learning (ML) models offer a beacon of hope in the fight against liver disease. Researchers can now predict the onset and progression of liver disease more accurately than ever by employing models such as RandomForest, LightGBM, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Ensemble Learning Stacking, and ExtraTrees. These models, through their predictive capabilities, have the potential to revolutionize how we approach CLD, making it possible to identify at-risk individuals earlier and tailor interventions more effectively. The impact of these technological innovations could be profound, significantly reducing mortality rates by enabling the medical community to act swiftly and decisively in preventing and managing liver disease.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease, a long-term kidney disorder that leads to high cardiovascular disease, is mainly caused by diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and urinary infections. Kidneys are vital organs in the human body, so early detection of chronic kidney disorders is very necessary in order to startthe clinical process. This research mainly aims at categorizing whether the patient diagnosed has chronic kidney disease from the 24 attributes and comparing them with the values in the dataset to start the medical treatments at the earliest. This study has developed and implemented multiple models and the binary classification neural network got the most accurate result with an accuracy of 99.23%. We also noticed a very low loss value, which is 0.023%, due to the ReLu activation layer function in the hidden layer and the hard sigmoid and sigmoid functions in the output layers. Along with this, the other models deployed include Decision Tree, Extra Tree and Support Vector Machine models in order to get the most accurate model for predicting chronic kidney disease from the provided dataset. The accuracy records of the employed models are Extra Tree (98.75%), Decision Tree (95.0%), and Support Vector Machine (93.75%).

AB  - Nowadays, due to busy schedules, many people are unaware of what they are eating and their physical condition. This scenario will lead to various health issues such as obesity, diabetes, blood pressure, etc. Hence, it has become very essential for people to have a good balanced nutritional healthy diet to deal with those issues. Therefore, it is important to determine what factors may be conducive to healthy eating behaviors among people with different Body Mass Index (BMI). A predictive analysis approach in data mining can be used to identify the food consumption pattern in people's eating habits and how it is related to their body type. This study aims to classify body types based on eating habits and physical conditions using a decision tree induction algorithm. Several phases have been conducted in this study such as data understanding, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation. In the experimental phase, the datasets that are known as full dataset and reduced dataset have been used to identify which dataset will produce high accuracy. As a result, it is shown that a full dataset produces higher accuracy compared to a reduced dataset. Perhaps there is room for improvement in the reduced dataset by applying other attribute selection methods to produce better accuracy of the classifier. This study brings a high significance for effectiveness and efficiency in eating habits and physical condition analysis based on body type, and it can also be explored for other classification methods for future work enhancement.

AB  - This paper presents an integrated and scalable precision health service for health promotion and chronic disease prevention. Continuous real-time monitoring of lifestyle and environmental factors is implemented by integrating wearable devices, open environmental data, indoor air quality sensing devices, a location-based smartphone app, and an AI-assisted telecare platform. The AI-assisted telecare platform provided comprehensive insight into patients’ clinical, lifestyle, and environmental data, and generated reliable predictions of future acute exacerbation events. All data from 1,667 patients were collected prospectively during a 24-month follow-up period, resulting in the detection of 386 abnormal episodes. Machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms were used to train modular chronic disease models. The modular chronic disease prediction models that have passed external validation include obesity, panic disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with an average accuracy of 88.46%, a sensitivity of 75.6%, a specificity of 93.0%, and an F1 score of 79.8%. Compared with previous studies, we establish an effective way to collect lifestyle, life trajectory, and symptom records, as well as environmental factors, and improve the performance of the prediction model by adding objective comprehensive data and feature selection. Our results also demonstrate that lifestyle and environmental factors are highly correlated with patient health and have the potential to predict future abnormal events better than using only questionnaire data. Furthermore, we have constructed a cost-effective model that needs only a few features to support the prediction task, which is helpful for deploying real-world modular prediction models.

AB  - Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater. Obesity is a complex medical condition characterized by excess body fat that increases the risk of developing co-morbidities like cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Excess weight is a global concern with an ever-growing prevalence. This research study aims to develop effective and practical post-surgical guidelines based on clinical data to determine potential predictors of surgical success. With this information, clinicians and patients can work together to minimize long-term weight regain post-surgery. To fulfill this goal, we applied various machine learning (ML) algorithms to model our dataset and provide a list of critical features to target to have more successful long-term weight-loss outcomes. Fortunately, our ML models achieved outstanding Mean Absolute Errors (0.10 - 0.22).

AB  - Studies show poor lifestyle choices and unhealthy eating patterns cause issues like obesity and other ongoing illnesses that raise the risk of heart attacks, such as hypertension, abnormal blood sugar levels, and diabetes. To improve this situation a lot of health apps have been built which use modern dietary monitoring systems that automatically evaluate dietary intake using machine learning and deep learning techniques rather. For these reasons indepth investigations on food detection, classification, and analysis have been conducted. Some of the top methods for automatic food recognition created have been discussed in this paper. We also propose an idea for detection of Indian food items using image classification. According to our findings of the papers we reviewed, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been extensively been used in food detection as it has been giving better results compared to other models. We also observed that Vision transformers perform better in situations where the dataset is large and a hybrid model would give better accuracy. A review of potential applications for food image analysis, shortfalls in the area, and open issues concludes the paper.

AB  - Obesity and sedentary lifestyles have become significant health concerns globally. To solve these issues, this system presents a Diet Plan and Home Exercise Recommendation System (SYP) that utilizes users' smartwatch data and pathological information to generate personalized diet plans and exercise recommendations. The proposed SYP system leverages the capabilities of modern smartwatches, which are equipped with various sensors to collect comprehensive health data. Additionally, it incorporates users' pathological data obtained through medical tests. By integrating these diverse datasets, the system can provide tailored recommendations based on an individual's specific health profile. The SYP system operates in two main phases: data collection and recommendation generation. During the data collection phase, the system collects and analyzes data from users' smartwatches and pathological records, such as heart rate, sleep patterns, blood pressure, glucose levels, and body mass index. The collected data is then processed to extract relevant features and construct a comprehensive health profile for each user. In the recommendation generation phase, the SYP system employs machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's health profile and generate personalized diet plans and home exercise recommendations. The generated recommendations are designed to be practical, feasible, and aligned with the user's health objectives.

AB  - Overweight and obesity are pointed out as a serious threat to the health of people. According to a 2016 report by WHO, 1.9 billion people worldwide are overweight and 650 million are obese. Because the obesity causes various cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and musculoskeletal disorders, it is important to assess the risk of obesity in order to prepare its prevention policies. To deal with this problem, logistic regressions and decision trees are widely applied and then employed as primary classifiers. This paper intends to present a combined learning approach to classifying the risk of overweight and obesity. In our framework, logistic regression models are cascaded onto decision tree classifiers. This feature would be applicable to improving the predictive capability of primary classifiers. Experimental results, using an open dataset provided by Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, show that the proposed scheme improves the classification accuracy by 5% to 27%.

AB  - Obesity is a major health problem, increasing the risk of various major chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and stroke. While the role of obesity identified by cross-sectional BMI recordings has been heavily studied, the role of BMI trajectories is much less explored. In this study, we use a machine learning approach to subtype individuals' risk of developing 18 major chronic diseases by using their BMI trajectories extracted from a large and geographically diverse EHR dataset capturing the health status of around two million individuals for a period of six years. We define nine new interpretable and evidence-based variables based on the BMI trajectories to cluster the patients into subgroups using the k-means clustering method. We thoroughly review each cluster's characteristics in terms of demographic, socioeconomic, and physiological measurement variables to specify the distinct properties of the patients in the clusters. In our experiments, the direct relationship of obesity with diabetes, hypertension, Alzheimer's, and dementia has been re-established and distinct clusters with specific characteristics for several of the chronic diseases have been found to be conforming or complementary to the existing body of knowledge.

AB  - Chronic diabetes Mellitus (DM) leads to severe consequences such as nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Various learning algorithms are employed to forecast and categorize eight issues, encompassing metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia. Machine learning is revolutionizing various domains by enabling algorithms to extract models from data. The main objective of this proposed study is to utilize binary classifiers to predict and categorize eight problems associated with DM. For this study we have used the dataset obtained from the Jeevandeep Hospital and Research Centre (JHRC) in Baripada, Mayurbhanj, Odisha, India. It includes 1296 records and has nine input variables and eight output categories that indicate different issues. Multiple models were constructed to address problems like Nephropathy, neuropathy, dyslipidemia, diabetic foot, metabolic syndrome, retinopathy, hypertension, and obesity. Different preprocessing operations on missing data, unbalanced data, and feature selection are employed. Binary classifiers were developed for each type of complication, with the number of records varied for each. Subsequently, an evaluation was conducted. The models achieved a maximum of 95.7% accuracy and 97.9% F1 score. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using selected features to build accurate classifiers for predicting diabetes complications.

AB  - There is a significant amount of interest in machine learning, and scientists generally examine its application in every possible setting. Breast cancer is one of the diseases that have the highest mortality rate among women. As a result of a delay in the detection of malignant tissues, it is also known as the second biggest cause of mortality in the world. Postmenopausal symptoms, obesity, genes passed down from families, hormonal imbalance, and genetic abnormalities that are not expressed are the most prevalent risk factors for breast cancer. Even though breast cancer is being discovered at a later stage in many underdeveloped nations, death rates remain excessively high. Early detection is essential if we are to bring the mortality toll down and save more lives. Histopathological pictures are the types of data that are taken into consideration by the suggested method. In this article, we will concentrate mostly on distinguishing between benign and malignant forms of cancer. In this investigation, the diagnosis of breast cancer was accomplished by the application of linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The model is evaluated with the assistance of efficiency indicators such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as the F1-score.

AB  - The burgeoning prevalence of obesity worldwide has triggered interest in the health and quality of life repercussions it carries. Weight loss shows promising results when it comes to tackling the consequences. Dietitians and nutritionists recommend logging daily intake of food items. Manual entry is tedious; hence, we propose a digital system that allows one to recognize a food item and estimate its calories by clicking a single image from the top. The proposed system identifies food items using an incrementally trained AdaBoost classifier, which takes as input a 94 dimension feature vector. The image is further processed using morphological operations, edge detection algorithms and contour detection techniques to segment the food item and compute its volume for calorie estimation. The classification algorithm gives a 90% accuracy while the estimated calories have a relative error of 18%.

AB  - Although the healthcare sector is generally “information-rich,” sadly, not all data are mined, which is necessary for finding hidden patterns and making wise decisions. In medical research and especially in the prediction of heart disease, sophisticated data mining methods are used. These methods are also used to predict the data that is contained in databases. In this article, prediction systems for heart failure have been examined using a larger number of input attributes. The method analyses 13 variables, including medical words like sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol, to forecast the risk that a patient will develop heart disease. 13 attributes have been used for prediction. In this study, smoking and obesity were introduced as two more characteristics. In the existing systems, we have used Naïve Bayes and neural networking systems, which have less accuracy compared to the proposed system algorithms. On a database of heart diseases, the proposed data mining classification algorithms J48 Decision Trees, Bagging, and Adaboost are examined. Based on the accuracy, these techniques' performances are contrasted. According to our findings, the Adaboost, J48 decision tree, and bagging accuracy are 92.1 percent, 91.62 percent, and 90.52 percent, respectively. Our investigation reveals that Adaboost, out of these three classification methods, accurately predicts heart failure.

AB  - Dietary patterns can be the primary reason for many chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. State-of-the-art wearable sensor technologies can play a critical role in assisting patients in managing their eating habits by providing meaningful statistics on critical parameters such as the onset, duration, and frequency of eating. For an accurate yet fast food intake recognition, this work presents a novel Machine Learning (ML) based framework that shows promising results by leveraging optimized support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The SVM classifiers are trained on three comprehensive datasets: OREBA, FIC, and CLEMSON. The developed framework outperforms existing algorithms by achieving F1-scores of $\bf 92\%$, $\bf 94\%$, $\bf 95\%$, and $\bf 85\%$ on OREBA-SHA, OREBA-DIS, FIC, and CLEMSON datasets, respectively. In order to assess the generalization aspects, the proposed SVM framework is also trained on one of the three databases while being tested on the others and achieves acceptable F1-scores in all cases. The proposed algorithm is well suited for real-time applications since inference is made using a few support vector parameters compared to thousands in peer deep neural networks models.

AB  - The prevalence of cardiovascular disease has been steadily rising, driven by factors such as sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy dietary habits, tobacco use, obesity, and an aging population. According to the According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the (GBD) study, cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death. In addition to comparing the performance of the five machine learning algorithms and two different datasets, this study also aims to investigate the impact of different algorithmic approaches on heart disease prediction. Logistic regression is a widely-used algorithm for binary classification, utilizing a linear function to model the relationship between input features and the target variable. K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm relies on similarity measures to classify instances based on their proximity to known instances. Random forest, a powerful ensemble method, combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. Decision tree algorithms employ a hierarchical structure of nodes and branches to make sequential decisions. Support vector machines (SVM) aim to find an optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space To conduct the evaluation, a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository containing relevant features and corresponding heart disease labels was utilized. Prior to training and testing the algorithms, the dataset underwent exploratory data analysis to understand its characteristics. Preprocessing steps were employed to handle missing values and scale the features appropriately. To ensure unbiased evaluation, the collection of data is subsequently split between train and testing collections with a 70 to 30 ratio. Several factors, such as the F1 score, an area underneath a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), recall, accuracy, and exactness were used to assess the algorithms' performance. Depending on the experimental findings, the random forest method outperformed logistic regression, KNN, decision trees, and SVM in terms of all assessment measures. Its greater F1 score, AUC, recall, accuracy, and precision all point to its improved capacity to distinguish between cases and non-cases of heart disease.

AB  - The amount of data being gathered in the modern world is enormous. This information was gathered from a variety of places, including the manufacturing, healthcare, and social media industries. The healthcare sector provides a lot of information. Particularly heart disease, wherein a lack of blood flow results in the tissue in the heart muscle dying and causes chest pain and heart attacks. When heart disease is diagnosed early on, it is possible to successfully cure the condition. Heart attacks are on the rise among people today for a variety of reasons, including high work demands, a lack of physical activity, irregular eating patterns, obesity, and consuming foods high in fat. India carries a high burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with the anticipated figure of deaths related to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) on a yearly basis is predicted to experience a sharp rise from 2.26 million in 1990 to 4.77 million in the year 2020[1]. This study’s main objective is to use machine learning models to detect heart attacks. The evaluation of the model in just not limited to the accuracy metrics, though accuracy of the model plays an important role, recall (TPR) has been also given importance. In healthcare applications like heart disease prediction, high recall is important to correctly identify most cases of the disease. However, precision might be lower to avoid misclassifying patients who do not have the condition upon further diagnosis. Balancing both is crucial for an effective and accurate prediction model. Finding coronary artery disease in its earliest stages could mean the difference between thousands of people’s lives and deaths.

AB  - The most common and widespread disease among today's population is liver disease, which is caused by excessive alcohol consumption, polluted gas produced by various chemical factories, drugs, spoiled or tainted food, and obesity. Liver is the most important body organ as it performs the detoxification process. As a result, early disease detection plays a crucial role in the disease diagnosis and recovery process. Early prediction of liver disease has been made possible with the introduction of machine learning technology. This technology provides significant benefits to the healthcare sector by developing new ways to deploy early disease prediction system even in a remote location. SVM, KNN, K-Mean clustering, neural networks, decision trees, and other machine learning techniques are used to implement liver disease diagnosis in order to provide varying levels of accuracy, precision and sensitivity. Unsupervised learning, supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning can also be used. This research study intends to compare all the machine learning algorithms to investigate and predict the liver disease and the resultant performance is evaluated based on sensitivity, relevance, accuracy, and precision.

AB  - Liver disease can be genetic. The liver can be damaged by alcohol use, obesity and hepatitis viruses. Chronic liver disease has many causes like Liver cancer, Cirrhosis and life threatening conditions. So prevention treatment can help to heal the damage and prevent liver failure. Hence, the time required to introduce the machine learning techniques which minimize the error and give more accuracy. Aim of this research paper is categories into two phases. In the first phase six classification algorithms (LR, KNN, SVM, NB, DT, and RF) are compared with ML Classification evaluation metrics. As a consequence, Logistic Regression obtained a higher accuracy of 71.6% in liver disease prediction than the other classification algorithms. In Phase 2, we selected a sample from a classification method with lower accuracy, such as Random Forest, Decision Tree algorithms and we adjusted the hyper parameters. RF accuracy is improved after Hyper Parameter Optimization by +4%, whereas Decision Tree algorithm accuracy is improved by +12%.

AB  - The rapid growth of chronic diseases and medical conditions (e.g. obesity, depression, diabetes, respiratory and musculoskeletal diseases) in many OECD countries has become one of the most significant wellbeing problems, which also poses pressure to the sustainability of healthcare and economies. Thus, it is important to promote early diagnosis, intervention, and healthier lifestyles. One partial solution to the problem is extending long-term health monitoring from hospitals to natural living environments. It has been shown in laboratory settings and practical trials that sensor data, such as camera images, radio samples, acoustics signals, infrared etc., can be used for accurately modelling activity patterns that are related to different medical conditions. However, due to the rising concern related to private data leaks and, consequently, stricter personal data regulations, the growth of pervasive residential sensing for healthcare applications has been slow. To mitigate public concern and meet the regulatory requirements, our national multi-partner SPHERE-DNA project aims to combine pervasive sensing tech-nology with secured and privacy-preserving distributed privacy frameworks for healthcare applications. The project leverages local differential privacy federated learning (LDP-FL) to achieve resilience against active and passive attacks, as well as edge computing to avoid transmitting sensitive data over networks. Combinations of sensor data modalities and security architectures are explored by a machine learning architecture for finding the most viable technology combinations, relying on metrics that allow balancing between computational cost and accuracy for a desired level of privacy. We also consider realistic edge computing platforms and develop hardware acceleration and approximate computing techniques to facilitate the adoption of LDP-FL and privacy preserving signal processing to lightweight edge processors. A proof-of-concept (PoC) multimodal sensing system will be developed and a novel multimodal dataset will be collected during the project to verify the concept.

AB  - Now-a-days, children are more indulged in indoor activities instead of outdoor games. This plays a very negative role on their minds along with physical laziness and obesity. The proposed system that solves this issue uses virtual reality gaming interface and activity recognition system for the users to play outdoor games in their rooms. People can wear the headsets along with wearables and can enjoy 3D games while exercising. The system uses sensors (MPU6050) connected with nRF24L01 modules and Arduino responsible for sending the sensor data to the game. Moreover, the data by sensor is processed using a machine learning model, which predicts the game played by the user. The proposed system aims at recognizing six basic games in the IMSporting behaviors dataset, which utilizes triaxial accelerometers connected to the subject’s knee, wrist, and below neck areas to capture human activities i.e., badminton, basketball, table tennis, skipping, cycling and football. WISDM dataset is used to recognize activities such as jogging and walking. The system has achieved an accuracy of 92% by using median filter as a pre-processing technique, Fourier transform features extraction and artificial neural networks classifier. The system can be applied to many fields like education, offices, construction and sports. Extensive experimentation proved the validity of the proposed system.

AB  - The non-caloric sweeteners market is catching up with the market of conventionally used sugars due to the benefits of preventing obesity, tooth decay and other health problems. Developing strategies for designing easier-to-produce novel molecules with a sweet taste and less toxicity are up-to-date motivations for the food industry. In this sense, Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been reported as cutting-edge technologies to guide the design of new molecules towards specific objectives, including sweet taste. The largest known dataset of sweet molecules is here provided. The dataset contains fully integrated 9541 sweeteners and 1141 bitterants from FooDB, FlavorDB and literature. This robust dataset allowed the development of standard Machine and Deep Learning pipelines towards conceiving Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) between molecules and sweetness. In this work, we showcase that Textual Convolutional Neural Networks (TextCNN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) outperformed most of traditional “shallow” learning approaches. These Deep Learning (DL) models produced platforms to guide the design of new sweeteners and repurposing existing compounds. Sixty million compounds from PubChem were evaluated using these models. Herein, we deliver a dataset of 67724 compounds that present high probabilities of being sweet. Quick searches in literature allowed us to find 13 molecules reported as potent sweetening agents, revealing that our approach is suitable for finding new sweeteners, valuable to expand food chemistry databases, repurposing existing chemicals and designing novel molecules with a sweet taste.

AB  - Globally, cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death; According to estimates, it takes an average of nearly 18 million lives each year according to the surveys. Recent development in the medical industry can bring a good solution to this using machine learning predictions. Individuals may suffer from elevated overweight and obesity, blood sugar, blood lipids, blood pressure, and blood glucose as a result of behavioral risk factors. Here, this research work has developed a prediction model by applying an ensemble technique on KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The unique combination of these basic models with the bagging technique will create an improved model that will have an advantage over the current models in the quicker and more accurate prediction of cardiac problems, hence assisting the medical professionals. To detect the outliers and important features, Recursive Feature Elimination and Inter Quartile Range (IQR) methods are used. A web interface is used to collect user records to forecast cardiac disease.

AB  - Body Mass Index (BMI) is a commonly used measure of body fat based on an individual's height and weight. Public health authorities and organizations monitor BMI at a population level to assess the prevalence and trends of under-weight and obesity within communities. This helps identify at-risk populations, evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and develop targeted strategies to promote healthy weight and prevent associated health problems. However, there is a lack of BMI monitoring methods that do not require active cooperation or cause privacy concerns to human subjects. This paper introduces a BMI classification approach based on passive WiFi sensing. Our proposed approach is inspired by the observation that different body shapes cause dissimilar impacts on WiFi signal propagation, which can be reflected by Channel State Information (CSI) readings. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, we developed a BMI sensing system that classifies the BMI of human subjects when they move in a WiFi range. Our evaluation results show that our approach could be an effective tool for public-health-oriented BMI monitoring, yielding a precision rate of 70.86%, a recall rate of 71.21 %, and an F1 score of 73.66%.

AB  - Many individuals visit the emergency room due to severe discomfort caused by kidney stones. A kidney stone is a hard, solid particle of a substance that forms as a result of the minerals in the urine. They are the outcome of a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Obesity, certain foods, drugs, and a lack of water can all contribute to this illness. Kidney stones can be of various shapes and sizes. Numerous research and imaging modalities have detected the existence of kidney stones. To completely interpret and diagnose, these pictures require the knowledge of a medical specialist. Clinicians who use computer-aided diagnosis systems as supplemental tools gain considerably from the practical techniques provided by these systems. Nonetheless, the presence of noise has resulted in some errors in kidney stone classification. Machine learning (ML) has recently made remarkable progress, and this study suggests an automatic diagnosis of kidney stones based on coronal computed tomography scans (CT). For research, cross-sectional CT images were collected, yielding a total of 2600 images. Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and an ensemble (combination of the LR and RF) are used. The different metrics are used to compare the ML model for identifying the best model. From the metrics comparison, it is identified as all the positive metrics will be high for the ensemble method and negative metrics will be low for the LR model.

AB  - Human emotions play a key role in making decisions and solving problems in various situations in our daily lives. Poor mental health can reduce our body's immune power paving the way to mental health issues like depression, anxiety and stress. A healthy amount of stress may be motivating and useful, but excessive, continuing stress or a strong reaction to stress can cause obesity, heart attacks, type 2 diabetes, stomach pains, body aches, menstrual cycle disruption, meningitis, and other health problems. Due to this reason, it has become essential to perform periodic research on both the identification and prediction of emotional states. Wearables and other Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies for monitoring mental health might totally replace or supplement psychologists as technology advances. This study aims to predict valence and arousal in emotional dimensions space using different physiological biomarkers collected in K-EmoCon dataset through wearable sensors and compare the outcomes of several prediction models using supervised machine learning techniques. Two emotional dimensions were considered namely valence and arousal in predicting emotions on a continuous scale using various regression algorithms like Decision tree, Random Forest, Multi-Linear, polynomial, XG boost, Ridge, and lasso model. These models are used to find the relevance of biomarkers and their contribution to predict different emotional states through different metrics like R2 score, Mean square error (MSE), Mean absolute error (MAE), and Root mean squared error (RMSE). According to experimental outcomes, Random Forest regressor outperforms the other algorithms with an R2 score of 0.84 and MSE of 0.27 respectively.

AB  - Dietary habits play a significant role in public health and well-being. Monitoring dietary activities is thus essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing many widespread diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. In this work, we present a low-cost wearable neckband for automatic diet activity monitoring. The $5 fabric-based device, comprising an electret microphone, a Bluetooth radio module, and a rechargeable Lithium-ion battery, can wirelessly transmit audio to a smart device in real-time. The classification algorithm processes the audio stream in 3s segments and extracts short-time spectral, waveform, and energy-based acoustic features. We compute various statistical functions from the acoustic features to obtain segmental feature vectors, which are subsequently used for machine learning. We perform an experimental evaluation using an in-house dataset collected using the neckband. We compare the performance of different classifiers in distinguishing between drinking, chewing solid foods, and other non-dietary activities. An averaged class-wise F-measure of 81.25% is achieved using the proposed wearable device and a Random Forest (RF) based classifier.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have a significant impact on increasing the mortality rate in the Middle East has one of the highest age-standardized death rates for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recently, based on the Assessment Risk Tools for Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD), World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 40% of all fatalities are attributed to cardiovascular diseases which has been linked to the main Risk Factors (RF) advances as obesity, hypertension, tobacco, and high cholesterol. In most of the cases, angiography is a reliable method for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is a costly approach associated with various complications. The significant increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and the subsequent complications and treatment costs have urged researchers to plan for the better examination, prevention, early detection, and effective treatment of these conditions. The present study aimed to determine the patterns of cardiovascular diseases using integrated classification techniques for analyzing the data of internal medicine patients who are at the risk of heart failure with 2621 samples and 40 characteristics. Selecting the characteristics and evaluating the influential factors are essential to the development of classifiers and increasing their accuracy. The proposed work suggested a model based on Gini-Entropy-Regression Model (GERM). The objective is to predict future risk with a certain probability and compared its performance with Deep Learning MLP Model.

AB  - Obesity has developed as a major global concern in the modern era due to the continuing trend towards unhealthy lifestyles characterized by excessive junk food consumption, insufficient sleep patterns, and prolonged periods of sedentary behavior. This research aims to predict the possibility of obesity using machine learning algorithms. We collected data from a total of 250 samples, which included moms and school-aged children of varied ages, as well as those affected by obesity and those who were not. Six well-ML learning techniques were used to study this. We used supervised machine learning techniques including RF, DT, GB, adaboost, catboost, and MLP to evaluate the suggested model. The results showed that combining the AdaBoost and MLP algorithms produced the best results, with 96% accuracy, 92% precision, 96% recall, and 94% F1. Using machine learning to analyze public health data can improve forecasts, find complicated patterns, and improve our understanding of issues such as identifying obesity risk factors.

AB  - Estimation for obesity levels is always an important topic in medical field since it can provide useful guidance for people that would like to lose weight or keep fit. The article tries to find a model that can predict obesity and provides people with the information of how to avoid overweight. To be more specific, this article applied dimension reduction to the data set to simplify the data and tried to Figure out a most decisive feature of obesity through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on the data set. The article also used some machine learning methods like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree to do prediction of obesity and wanted to find the major reason of obesity. In addition, the article uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to do prediction which has more powerful feature extraction ability to do this. Finally, the article found that family history of obesity is the most decisive feature, and it may because of obesity may be greatly affected by genes or the family eating diet may have great influence. And both ANN and Decision tree’s accuracy of prediction is higher than 90%.

AB  - The increasing overweight and obesity rates pose a significant risk to public health globally, as it is closely associated with various diseases and higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Prompt and effective intervention in the early stages is therefore crucial. Furthermore, identifying obesity risk factors is essential to combat the growing rates of several secondary health problems such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and other comorbidities. This study aims to unveil the key factors playing a remarkable role in shaping this situation, utilizing the immense potential of machine learning methods. The proposed pipeline implements feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The extracted subset of the original secondary dataset is then employed to train different state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, along with the proposed novel stacking ensemble model. The proposed model outperforms other models, achieving a noteworthy accuracy of 99.58% with an AUC score of 1.0, when combined with the SMOTE-ENN balancing technique. Additionally, model explainable tool SHAP is used to rank the features according to their individual contribution, providing a more in-depth explanation of how each feature impacts the model outcome. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and extensive datasets, this approach can significantly improve early-stage obesity prediction by uncovering its underlying causes.

The age old popular notion for the disease lies in physical conditions (PC), and eating habits (EH), leading to much observed debate for the root cause of obesity. This study establishes the omnipotence of PC over EH as a leading cause of obesity. The dataset used for the study comprised of 16 features which were divided into two feature subsets (FSS); one FSS containing 9 PC features, and the other FSS containing features related to EH. Initially obesity was classified using the complete feature dataset, followed by classification using the PC and EH FSSs respectively. Eight Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used for the study. Regular performance metrics were used to evaluate the results. It was observed that the PC features unanimously contributed to obesity in contrast to EH features. Moreover, boosting was done using six algorithms, and results reflected that all the boosting algorithms enhanced the results. Of all the boosting algorithms, Hist-Gradient Boost generated the best results. The prime focus of the study is to analyze the major features for obesity using ML algorithms including boosting. This study computationally concludes that physical conditions have a greater impact on obesity with respect to eating habit conditions.

AB  - Automatic assessment of speech disorders is a cutting-edge topic in vocal analysis. Recent studies indicated possible connections between eating disorders and voice alterations. In this work, we assessed the influence of obesity and Gastro- Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) on voice, being the former a risk factor for the latter. Moreover, we investigated the mutual influence of the diseases working with a consistent set of features. To these aims, we used vocal tests from 92 subjects, with vocal tests consisting of vowel phonation and sentence repetition, and subjects including healthy controls, obese patients, patients with GERD, and obese patients with GERD. Machine Learning models, consisting of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine, were successfully employed on extracted features in binary classifications, resulting in 0.86 and 0.82 of accuracies on validation set in scoring the presence of GERD and obesity, respectively. The absence of performance deterioration when moving to the test set denoted a lack of overfitting. As for the tasks and the features employed, the sentence repetition proved to be more effective than the vowel phonation, while Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Perceptual Linear Prediction Coefficients, Bark Band Energy Coefficients, and noise measures appear to be among the most significant features for the application at hand.

AB  - This paper describes the implementation of a comprehensive clinical decision support system (CDSS) for the risk factors prediction of comorbidities related to obesity and for the characterization of indirect connections between such comorbidities and non-communicable diseases. In particular, the direct correlation between obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular, and heart disease is analyzed by using machine learning (ML) predictive models, while the connection of the co-occurring disorders to the numerous additional non-communicable diseases is analyzed via a graph-based user interface. The CDSS here proposed is, therefore, structured with three main components: ML predictive models based on publicly available datasets, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) local and global model interpretation, and graph-based representation of non-communicable disease connections. Multiple ML models are presented for risk assessment and a comparison is carried out based on performance key performance indicators. The best-performing model for each disease was proved to be: the multi-layer perceptron for diabetes and heart disease, and extreme gradient boosting for cardiovascular disease. Comorbidities risk factor prediction and a XAI local model explanation is performed on significant case studies. In addition, XAI global model interpretation is given for the entire dataset providing insights on the features’ contribution to the models’ implementation. Moreover, the graph-based visualization of indirect disease co-occurrence is performed by filtering connections according to different relative risk factor thresholds. This interface can be exploited by healthcare professionals to obtain, according to the needs and the clinical approach, a global perspective on obesity and its associated pathologies prevention as well as long-term treatment and care provision.

AB  - Postprandial hyperglycemia (PPHG) is detrimental to health and increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, reduced eyesight, and life-threatening conditions like cancer. Detecting PPHG events before they occur can potentially help with providing early interventions. Prior research suggests that PPHG events can be predicted based on information about diet. However, such computational approaches (1) are data hungry requiring significant amounts of data for algorithm training; and (2) work as a black-box and lack interpretability, thus limiting the adoption of these technologies for use in clinical interventions. Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose, DietNudge1, a machine learning based framework that integrates multi-modal data about diet, insulin, and blood glucose to predict PPHG events before they occur. Using data from patients with diabetes, we demonstrate that our model can predict PPHG events with up to 90% classification accuracy and an average F1 score of 0.93. The proposed decision-tree-based approach also identifies modifiable factors that contribute to an impending PPHG event while providing personalized thresholds to prevent such events. Our results suggest that we can develop simple, yet effective, computational algorithms that can be used as preventative mechanisms for diabetes and obesity management.

AB  - In this paper, the data set of food and nutrition intake from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and COVID-19 case counts from the World Health Organization (WHO) are used to analyze the relationship between diet and COVID-19 infections in different countries. Different machine learning algorithms, like regression, clustering, and classification, are used to process and analyze the data set. In addition, an improved random forest method for feature selection is proposed. This paper has studied the relationship between food intake and obesity or undernourished, the association between the amount of food consumed and the amount of fat, protein, and calories consumed through that food, and the impact on the confirmed, deaths and recovery rate of COVID-19. The purpose is trying to find some foods that can prevent or assist in the treatment of COVID-19, and achieve a non-pharmaceutical intervention for COVID-19 through a healthy diet.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a medical disorder characterized by a number of metabolic abnormalities, such as hypertension, obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. Improved cardiovascular disease-related health outcomes can be achieved with early MS risk prediction in middle-aged adults. To enable an early and accurate diagnosis, a multitude of machine learning algorithms have been developed to support the clinical diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. This work aimed to identify the optimal MS prediction model using the state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Using a dataset, we have implemented machine learning algorithms for the purpose of early diagnosis and prediction of MS. For MS prediction, feature selection strategies were combined with machine learning models such logistic regression, XGBoost, Adaboost, Random Forests, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Naïve Bayes. After analyzing the results of each classifier, it was revealed that the Adaboost, Catboost and Random Forest classifier had the greatest and most dependable accuracy of 83.5%, 82.3% and 83%.

AB  - In this era, everyone wants to be fit and healthy by maintaining proper diet plans. Fitness has become a major concern in the modern world. Body Mass Index (BMI) value has nowadays become the benchmark for deciding whether a person is obese or not, as obesity may lead to many health-related problems. Thus, BMI screens for weight categories i.e., obesity which may lead to health problems. This work aims to create an intelligent system which can give the accurate fitness level of a person based on his/her gender, height, and weight by calculating BMI. In this paper, Machine Learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boost algorithm are used to predict the status of obesity levels and have achieved accuracy of 97% by KNN, 96% by RF and 95% by DT. BMI index is used to predict the status of health of an individual. “BMI-prediction of health status” dataset from Kaggle is used for the implementation of the aforementioned models and achieved the highest accuracy of 97%.

AB  - Obesity, a global public health concern, is escalating rapidly, especially in the Middle East, with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) witnessing one of the highest prevalence rates among adults and children. This multifactorial health issue is influenced by genetic, environmental, behavioral, and social factors. However, the challenge lies in the lack of comprehensive and representative data that encapsulates the diversity and complexity of the population, particularly in the UAE. This research paper presents a novel AI-driven approach to address the obesity problem in the UAE. The study employs state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques to generate local data that are realistic, diverse, and representative of the UAE population and the global obesity situation. The data is derived from four global datasets, two related to obesity and two related to diabetes. The paper also identifies key features and factors that influence obesity in the UAE using machine learning and feature extraction methods. A predictive model is built and evaluated using the local data and the best-performing classifier, the random forest classifier. Our study’s random forest classifier achieved a 94.83% accuracy when trained only on the global dataset. However, when fine-tuned on datasets synthesized with different augmentation methods, it showed better results: SMOTE excelled with 98.09% accuracy, TabGAN was close behind at 97.02%, and VAE lagged at 70.99%. Therefore, domain adaptation using the synthesized data confirmed the robustness of the generated data, with SMOTE and TabGAN outperforming the original dataset with accuracies of 98.09% and 97.22%, respectively.

AB  - One of the causes of chronic disease is obesity, where obesity is a condition of someone who is overweight. The beyond-weight problems simplest befell in high-earnings nations; however, weight problems are growing dramatically in low-and middle-earnings countries. Based on this, obesity needs further investigation to suppress the increasing number of obese people. To predict obesity levels, we use a machine learning approach in this study. The dataset is a dataset on obesity levels in adults, so the method used is a classification method including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, SVM, and Stacking Ensemble. This study uses Cross Validation (CV) to reduce the possibility of bias in the accuracy of results. The Cross Validation used is k = 10, 20, and 30. The classification method is evaluated using Performance measures, including accuracy, precision, and recalls, to get the best approach. This research includes data exploration, pre-processing data, seeking accuracy and comparing each method, namely Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, and SVM with CV k = 10, 20, and 30, and looking for accuracy and comparing the results of the stacking ensemble method with its meta-models. The highest accuracy is the accuracy value of the ensemble stacking method with the Gradient Boosting meta-model. The accuracy value obtained is 97.87% with k= 20 and k =30. With the same data, this accuracy is higher than the random forest, which gets an accuracy value of 97.64% with k = 20.

AB  - In recent years, China's material standard of life has improved as a result of the country's economic growth, the number of obese people in China has roughly tripled in 15 years, with half of all adults overweight or obese. Obesity is a major independent risk factors for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, closely related to the occurrence of such as esophageal cancer development also. In order to deal with this “public health crisis”, many ingredient recommendation systems have been developed for cooking healthy diets. In order to improve their performance, this study presents IPFC, an innovative and intelligent prediction tool, to predict people's food preference for cooking, where they can give more targeted recommendations. Our strategy is based on a dataset gathered through a real-world questionnaire, in which the questions are about participants' eating and behavior habits and their basic information. We utilize data mining methods on such a dataset. During the assessment tests, machine learning models such as ANN, DT, RF, SVM, GBDT, LR, and NB are evaluated for their ability to classify the dataset into several classes. The experimental findings demonstrate that SVM achieves a relatively higher accuracy than other considered machine learning models, whici is 50.00% using the test set that consists of a small number of data collected by us.

AB  - Worldwide, people are struggling with obesity and metabolic syndrome. For successful preventative interventions, it is necessary to predict and evaluate the risk factors linked to these illnesses. For the purpose of determining the potential of metabolic syndrome and obesity, this research presents a new cloud-driven logistic regression paradigm. Using the power of the cloud, we mined a massive dataset that included a wide range of demographic and clinical details. The cloud platform was used to build logistic regression models that analyzed intricate relationships among variables using powerful machine learning methods. A thorough assessment of risk variables is made possible by the framework’s incorporation of data from many sources. Predicting the likelihood of obesity and metabolic syndrome was a strong suit of our cloud-based logistic regression methodology. Important factors, such as genetic susceptibility, lifestyle variables, and clinical biomarkers, were discovered by the model. The ability to efficiently handle parallel data sets on the cloud improved the model’s predictive powers and made it possible to analyze massive datasets. An efficient and scalable method for large-scale evaluation of obesity and metabolic syndrome risk is provided by the suggested framework. The model may be easily adjusted to new trends and changing datasets using cloud-driven analytics, allowing real-time updates and enhancements. This study provides a powerful instrument for risk assessment and focused preventative actions, which advances public health initiatives and personalized treatment.

AB  - Biomedical text classification requires having training examples labeled by clinical specialists, a process that can be costly. To address this problem, active learning incrementally selects a subset of the most informative unlabeled examples, samples that are then labeled and used to train a given classifier, seeking to reduce the number of labeled samples. Nonetheless, the other unlabeled examples are not used by active learning, but incorporating semi-supervised techniques that use unlabeled samples could improve the representativeness of the data and the discriminatory power of the classifiers. This work proposes a generic semi-supervised learning framework for improving active learning and reducing the number of labeled training examples in biomedical text classification. The proposed framework combines manually annotated training examples selected by active learning and pseudo-labels obtained from a trained classifier. To evaluate the proposed framework, three biomedical datasets with textual information on obesity and smoking habit were used across different classification algorithms. The classification results show that the proposed framework can reduce the number of training examples that are manually labeled by clinical specialists by a 10% without affecting the performance of the classifiers. This performance is attributable to the ability of the classifiers to correctly select and label the training examples. Clinical relevance— We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised learning framework to reduce manual labeling efforts of biomedical texts by clinical specialists for the training of classifiers.

AB  - Heart disease is contributing one of the leading reasons of death in the contemporary world. The three major danger signs for heart disease are smoking, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and 47% of all US citizens have at least one of these risk factors. In the field of clinical data analysis, predicting cardiovascular disease is a major difficulty. In this case, Machine learning (ML) can be important for taking decisions and predictions about heart disease based on personal key indicators (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol level, smoking, diabetic status, obesity, stroke, alcohol drinking) of heart disease. In this paper, we proposed six machine learning models using survey data of over 400k US residents from the year 2020. The six machine learning models-Xgboost, Adaboost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes have been compared in detail. Through the prediction model for heart disease, we achieved an improved performance level with an accuracy level of 91.57% for the prediction of heart diseases with the logistic regression model.

AB  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal disorder which is associated with diverse symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, obesity, acne issues, hirsutism, alopecia, and excess secretion of androgen in women. These symptoms may vary from patient to patient and therefore it is important to get it diagnosed at an early stage as it may lead to serious health conditions like heart diseases, diabetes, endometrial cancer etc. Diagnosis of PCOS is performed using physical examination, laboratory tests and ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound is used to detect follicles or immature eggs present inside an ovary. Ovaries with PCOS can be easily detected using ultrasound where trans vaginal ultrasound is considered to be the most efficient technique as it provides an internal view of the ovaries especially in patients suffering from obesity. The ultrasound report consist of details like number of follicles present, and size of ovaries, luminal thickness etc., Manual detection is costly, and lengthy and may be prone to physician's error due to shortage of health staff in developing countries like India and lead to higher false positive rates. Therefore, an automated system for PCOS segmentation and classification can help in escalating this task. This paper reviews existing state-of-the-art works where classification and segmentation have been used for automated detection of PCOS. Various machine learning, deep learning and transfer learning techniques are discussed. It was observed that this research field needs technological advancements through release of open-source datasets, and robust automatic pipelines for fruitful detection of PCOS in women.

AB  - The goal of this research is to comprehend correlation between the daily activities and mental health of the children which have been under discussion over the recent years. Children (age 12 to 17) who suffer due to mental health issues are often stressed and depressed and as a result are said to fall into unhealthy eating habits which in turn causes obesity and various other heart diseases. Thus, in this study we will be identifying the daily activities that has major contributions towards the condition of becoming overweight, obese and mentally ill by using historical and statistical data along with ensemble machine learning techniques. The extra trees algorithm will be used to find the important features and their scores in this study. Further, In the end we will draw conclusions by distinguishing the features based on their scores and by giving them labels in order to observe an insight on major and minor contributions towards conditions for children on a day-to-day basis. The findings of this study can also inform future research on the complex relationship between daily activities, mental health, and obesity. Ultimately, the study aims to shed light on the factors that contribute to the health and well-being of children, which can have significant long-term implications for their physical and mental health as they transition into adulthood.

AB  - Heart failure is common problem among the people. Many people suffer from this problem. Bad eating habits, BMI level, obesity, in active daily life are the things which are responsible for heart failure. Many data sets about patients are available which stores information about heart of the human being. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are applied for making prediction of various diseases in recent years. ML models are trained on data sets and then trained models are tested on the tested data sets. Cross validation is a new tool to improve ML. In this paper accuracy of five ML models is calculated with and without cross validation. From results it is observed that cross validation improves the accuracy of all five ML models. The Random Forest ML model is best for heart disease prediction with 92.86% accuracy.

AB  - Eating disorders do not have a single cause, so the prediction of suffering from them is a complex issue. The economic cost associated with the treatment of diseases and disabilities derived from overweight and obesity is expensive in relation to the cost of prevention. This research aims to evaluate analysis techniques to identify the relationship between obesity in Mexico and several factors (variables) such as habits and physical conditions, using information technologies. Artificial Intelligence is a resource that can help in complex multifactorial issues, such as the identification of risks in different fields or combination of them. Methodologically, the use of Mexican public databases and expert knowledge is proposed to feed the Artificial Intelligence system to achieve early prediction and/or diagnosis of obesity condition. Throughout the bibliographic reference, the benefit of the use of these technologies for predictive analysis in the health arena is identified, being an opportunity to make this technology available to many people showing the impacts and consequently, favoring prevention. It is demonstrated how the Random Forest model presents a better performance with respect to the other techniques for the classification problem presented.

AB  - This paper presents a novel Clinical Decision Support System based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI-CDSS) as a comprehensive structured tool consisting of three main parts: predictive models, XAI interpretation, and a graph-based visualization of non-communicable pathologies. Machine learning models are proposed to predict the risk factors related to the direct association between obesity and comorbidities such as cardiovascular, heart disease, and diabetes. Multilayer perceptron and extreme gradient boosting are chosen among different machine learning algorithms as the best performing for the risk factors prediction of the selected comorbidities. They perform prediction with an accuracy of 0.72 for diabetes, and 0.73 for cardiovascular and heart disease. The intuitive XAI interface gives the end-user insight into the machine learning decision process, while the graph visualization links such co-occurrent pathologies to many other non-communicable diseases and provides a global view to healthcare professionals, usable for obesity and associated pathologies prevention and long-term treatment and care.

AB  - Elderly people are an important age group in society that must be constantly under control. Because of old age, these people suffer from various diseases such as blood sugar, blood pressure, and obesity. If the elderly are not treated and their diseases are not controlled by taking medicine, it will cause headaches, dizziness, and blurred vision, which will cause problems for them as a result of these symptoms. One of the problems they cause is physical and mental injury. Physical injuries in the elderly population are caused by falls. Therefore, providing methods to prevent them from falling can play an important role in their physical and mental health as well as in improving their quality of life. Machine learning algorithms can predict the condition of the elderly at any moment. If an elderly person has acute symptoms, the risk of falling can be prevented by turning on the smart sensors. In this study, we propose a method for predicting falls in elderly individuals with diabetes using a multilayer perception classifier. According to these results, elderly people with diabetes are more prone to falls because of symptoms caused by blood sugar, such as dizziness and motor nerve disorders. By designing an intelligent system that can predict the condition of the elderly based on various diseases, it is possible to prevent them from falling. In this study, various factors collected from this dataset were examined. By reviewing the data and confirming the opinion of a cardiovascular disease specialist, the elderly with diabetes had more symptoms, such as headache, dizziness, and blurred vision, than the rest of the elderly; therefore, these symptoms lead to a drop in blood pressure and fall. The results obtained from the implementation of the machine learning algorithm showed that machine learning could predict the risk of falling in elderly patients with diabetes with a high performance (accuracy=97%).

AB  - Over the past three decades, an increase in overweight and obesity has devastated public health. A better diet and increased exercise are encouraged by approaches for reducing obesity (PA). Two significant public health problems contributing to the rise in chronic illnesses that cannot be prevented are obesity and physical inactivity. Obese people cannot perform the necessary level of physical activity due to their lack of physical fitness and comorbidities. The obesity paradox, early weight loss, maintenance, and the importance of physical activity and exercise training (PA-ET) for avoiding body weight increase are all covered in this study. This research blends machine learning algorithms and a data-driven methodology to identify patterns in profiles related to weight change in a nutrition intervention programme. This study builds a web-based weight loss reminder system using fuzzy logic that allows users to keep track of their weight, caloric consumption, and physical activity. Aerobic ET programmes advocated for public health can result in moderate weight loss; however, individual weight loss varies greatly. Doctors should emphasize that even if patients don't lose weight, they can still benefit from their physical activity programme and educate patients about reasonable expectations. PA programmes continue to have a lot of health advantages. Finally, evidence demonstrates that obesity is treatable and preventable. It is possible to maintain weight loss attained with diet and exercise. This framework's main goal is to discover different thresholds that are susceptible to the harmful effects of obesity on health, and it was able to do so with 93.4 per cent efficiency.

AB  - Direct methods for accurately measuring the volume of fat tissue in the human body are not suitable for use in epidemiological studies due to their lack of precision. Therefore, indirect methods, such as indices and formulas, are used to estimate the percentage of body fat (BF%) in patients. While the body mass index (BMI) is a commonly used method, it does not differentiate between adipose tissue and other tissues, and only provides a height-weight ratio. Recent studies have shown that machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs), can effectively evaluate anthropometric parameters to obtain BF%. Although the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for this purpose remains a possibility for future research.The objective of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of ANNs in classifying abnormal values of BF%. The ANNs were trained using a database consisting of 7750 subjects, ranging in age from 17 to 102 years, and including 27 predictive variables. To evaluate the ANNs the accuracy (ACC), specificity (SPE), sensibility (SEN), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and F1 were calculated. The results suggest that ANNs are more effective than SVMs in addressing classification impaired BF%, although the difference between the two methods is not significant when compared to previous work that used the same database. Notably, ANNs outperformed SVMs in their ability to classify true negative values, achieving a success rate of NPV of above 98% compared to 85% for SVMs. This finding is consistent with the results obtained for specificity, where ANNs achieved a rate of above 99% compared to 67% for SVMs. Additionally, all other metrics (ACC, SEN, SPE, PPV, and F1) yielded results above to 96%.

AB  - Diabetes is a disease that occurs when the blood glucose level or blood sugar level meets high values. The level of sugar is increased in the human body is due to several factors like obesity, physical inactivity, gender, age, family history, food habits, and so on. Based on these attributes and with the help of machine learning techniques one can foresee diabetes. According to the increasing morbidity, the number of patients who suffer from diabetes will reach 642 million in 2040, which indicates one of the ten adults in the world will suffer from diabetes. Algorithms that are used in Machine learning can apply in the various medical health field to detect and predict diseases. In this paper, we applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes in Diabetes 130-US hospitals for the years 1999-2008 Data Set and Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset. We made a comparative study of the accuracy of all machine learning algorithms. In our diabetic prediction model, we got a higher accuracy value for the random forest algorithm.

AB  - The Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most widespread health concern currently affecting women in the world. The defining characteristics of PCOS are cysts in the ovaries and a hormonal imbalance. One in every five women in India is affected by PCOS because of the lack of awareness in women. The late identification of PCOS can also lead to high risk diseases including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity etc. Thus, the main objective of the paper is to examine how some features like heart diseases, obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure can be used for diagnosing PCOS through hybrid and classification algorithms. In order to determine the best performing algorithm in this scenario, the comparison is made among the six simple classification algorithms based on the performance metrics. The algorithm which gives the highest accuracy is further used in conjunction to create hybrid algorithms. The performance metrics and time taken is compared among all simple classification and hybrid algorithms. The most efficient algorithm is then can be further used for PCOS diagnosis which in turn saves time and cost.

AB  - Pregnancy-related diabetes is dangerous. Some pregnant women get diabetes despite the risk factors of lifestyle, family, and location. Diabetes persists after delivery and requires lifestyle changes, but pregnant women have managed it by finding new ways to reduce side effects. The gynecologist will advise the couple on when they can get pregnant, the risks to the mother and child, and the risk factors for gestational diabetes. The SQU Medical Journal [1] reported high rates of gestational and pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM) in pregnant Omanis. Preventing or counseling women to change their lifestyles before getting pregnant would reduce the risk to the mother and fetus. This study used AI and deep neural networks to examine its effects on pregnant women. The dataset examined women's gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) patterns across age groups and locations. Deep and feed-forward neural network, machine learning algorithms detect obesity, overweight, family history of diabetes, and other variables like blood RH factors before and after pregnancy. We are focusing on the obstetric and perinatal outcomes of pregnant Omanis with gestational and pregestational diabetes, using machine learning to predict gestational diabetes (GDM) early. To assess blood glucose levels in pregnant women aged 21–45 during the second trimester, determine the age-related frequency of GDM, and examine promising risk variables for GDM. This research's experimental testbed includes Google Colab, Python, Keras, PyTorch, Anaconda (IDE), TensorFlow, and Gradio. This research reduces delivery complications and pregnancy misshapes in pregnant women with diabetic families in Oman.

AB  - One of the leading causes of death is CVD(Cardiovascular disease) which is communally referred to as heart disease. CVD is the summation of disorders that affect the heart's ability to function. Every year, over 18 million people worldwide die as a result of heart disease. One in three deaths from cardiovascular disease in them is preventable, and heart attacks can be predicted months in advance by assessing the patient's risk factors. Obesity, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, and Glucose levels are some of the risk factors. The aim is to predict CVD based on risk factors of patients, who are affected by their habits and patients' basic health information, using the Cardiovascular Disease Dataset from Kaggle using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms. Smoking and Alcohol consumption are some practices that will maximize the possibility of getting cardiovascular disorders, and doing workouts will reduce the risk of getting cardiovascular disease. In our work, we have implemented four models for predicting CVD namely Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Deep Learning Model and Random Forest. The DL model, with an accuracy of 73.78 %, outperformed the other three models.

AB  - Obesity is a pervasive and hazardous condition that affects a significant portion of the global population, including developed countries such as the United States, where it is considered an epidemic. On the other hand, malnutrition remains a prevalent issue in many underdeveloped and developing countries. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a valuable metric for monitoring these conditions; however, calculating an individual's BMI requires precise measurements of height and weight, which can be a cumbersome process. To streamline this process, it may be possible to predict an individual's BMI from their photograph. this study employs Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques to develop and evaluate different models for predicting BMI from photographs. The dataset was collected via web scraping, and data augmentation techniques were employed to increase its size due to its limited availability. In addition to the web-scraped dataset, clean images from a related study were also included to supplement the dataset. The images were then segmented using UNet to improve predictions. The use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques, coupled with data augmentation and segmentation, resulted in an accurate model for predicting BMI from photographs. The findings from this study have the potential to aid in the prevention and treatment of obesity and malnutrition on a global scale.

AB  - Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated based on the ratio between a person’s height and weight, is a widely used metric for body weight or fatness. In this paper, we investigate the potential of face image-based BMI estimation using an RGB camera. We proposed a simple yet highly reproducible image processing framework that converts an input face image into a BMI value or obesity class (underweight, normal and overweight). In this framework, we explored the options of using 2D or 3D facial landmark models, view angle correction in 2D and 3D, different choices for facial feature extraction (landmark distances or coordinates), and different prediction models (regression or classification) based on shallow machine learning techniques. Our framework was thoroughly validated on two public datasets. The insights of this measurement are discussed, as well as the challenges and limitations, to increase the understanding for future improvement of camera-based BMI estimation. The source code of this study is available at https://github.com/hxfj/Facial-Landmark-based-BMI-Analysis.git.Clinical relevance— This contributes to simpler and more effective daily health management.

AB  - Diabetes is considered to be one of the worst illnesses in the world. Diabetes is caused by a combination of variables, including obesity, excessive blood glucose levels, and other causes. It does this by altering the insulin hormone, which in turn causes an irregular metabolism in the crab and raises its blood sugar levels. This program’s primary objective is to lessen the risk that people may acquire diabetes by making forecasts for them and urging them to take more care of their diet and lifestyle in the years to come. The key goals of this research were to develop and execute a method for predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques, as well as investigate the strategies that would be used to achieve success in this Endeavour. The suggested technique makes use of a wide variety of classification and ensemble learning algorithms, some examples of which include Knn, Label Encoder, and train test split. The results of the research may provide information that will help medical professionals make more accurate early predictions and judgments in order to better manage diabetes and save lives. The method first extracts information from a dataset, such as certain symptoms that may be utilized to gain further knowledge about diabetes, and then validates that information using other data. This paper objective was to build classification models for the diabetes data set, develop models that can determine whether or not a person is sick, and get the greatest possible validation scores in the models that were developed. Massive datasets may be found in the healthcare business. By investigating enormous datasets in this manner, we may uncover previously unknown information and trends, which will enable us to draw conclusions based on the data and make accurate forecasts. We categorize the dataset using random techniques since our major goal in doing this research is to determine the method that is the most accurate for predicting diabetes. This will be accomplished by integrating machine learning, data visualization, and data interpretation. The use of machine learning, which is becoming more important in the modern healthcare sector, will be the focus of this research. Massive datasets may be found in the healthcare business.

AB  - Diabetes is now a frequent condition among people worldwide. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing daily across various age groups due to numerous factors. Factors contributing to the development of diabetes include infections caused by bacteria or viruses, existence of chemical contaminants in food, autoimmune responses, obesity, unhealthy dietary patterns, lifestyle changes, alterations in eating habits, and environmental pollution. Therefore, diagnosis of diabetes in elementary stage is essential for preserving an individual’s life. Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes, is a significant metabolic condition that significantly affects a person’s overall health and wellness. Diabetes causes elevated blood sugar levels. Improper management of diabetes increases the likelihood of heart attack, retinopathy leading to vision loss, skin problems, and other ailments. Presently, there are over a million individuals affected by this condition. Early diabetes detection can help to take necessary measures. In this research, we applied the Support Vector Machine algorithm, a machine learning method, to detect patterns and risk factors in a dataset related to diabetes. This approach aids in effectively categorizing patients as either diabetic or non-diabetic.

AB  - As reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the major cause of death for both sexes and members of most racial and ethnic groups. Cardiovascular disease claims one life in the United States every 34 seconds. The expense of medical services, medications, and lost productivity because of deaths from heart disease causes the United States to lose a significant amount of money each year. At least half of all Americans have one or more of the following three major risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other significant indicators are the presence of diabetes, obesity (high body mass index), a lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption. In recent times, the healthcare sector has discovered that machine learning is a practical and reliable decision-making tool. The latter tends to assist doctors in making informed decisions about the heart condition of a patient. It has become increasingly important to develop an effective early-stage cardiac disease prognosis using digital patient information to enhance clinical decision-making. This study intends to find the most accurate machine learning classifiers for these prognostic uses. To predict cardiac disease, several supervised machine-learning algorithms were used and compared in terms of accuracy and performance. The following methods were used in our research: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K Nearest Neighbor. The heart disease dataset from Kaggle has been used to validate this research. The latter was created using data from the 2020 United States national health status survey of more than 410,000 people, performed yearly by the centers for disease control and prevention.

AB  - In the US, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and CAD, also known as chronic heart disease (CHD), are major causes of death for people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds, regardless of gender. Cardiovascular disease claims the lives of someone every 33 seconds, which is a very high rate of occurrence. Particularly, coronary heart diseases are responsible for a significant percentage of these deaths—375,476 people in 2021 alone. Important risk factors for heart disease include smoking, and a host of other illnesses and lifestyle choices, including diabetes, obesity, poor eating habits, inactivity, and excessive alcohol use. In the process of creating effective screening tools and estimating the risk of CHD, machine learning (ML) approaches have gained popularity. Using a dataset from Kaggle, this work presents an ensemble machine learning model for CHD prediction with an accuracy of around 94.06%. The random forest algorithm, which has been trained using copious clinical and demographic data related to CHD patients, is the main working mechanism of the model. Through the use of an ensemble approach—which combines many machine learning techniques—the suggested model outperforms individual approaches in terms of prediction. This emphasizes how combining different machine learning techniques may improve accuracy. According to the study's conclusions, the ensemble model has potential as a useful tool for early CHD diagnosis and treatment, which would lessen the disease's effects on patients and healthcare systems. Keywords: Coronary heart disease (CHD), extra trees (ET), Support Vector Machine (SVM), ischemic heart disease (IHD), Machine Learning (ML).

AB  - This research work develops and implements an integrated system using IoT technologies and machine learning algorithm to measure Body Mass Index (BMI) and perform health analytics in hospitals. Obesity, overweight, and chronic diseases are major public health issues. Healthcare workers need accurate and quick BMI readings to monitor weight status and health issues. To overcome these limitations, the proposed system uses IoT sensors to automate BMI evaluations and collect real-time health data. Wireless IoT devices interface with hospital information systems. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm analyzes BMI, physical activity, and vital sign data. It can identify and predict BMI values from data. SVM can predict BMI for customized weight loss recommendations. The proposed setup helps hospitals to automate BMI measuring, thus reducing medical staff burden and manual intervention. Real-time monitoring and analysis enable early identification and individualized treatment of obesity-related health concerns. IoT devices with the SVM algorithm enable data-driven decision-making, improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

AB  - Chronic diseases such as diabetes can have a devastating effect on a person's overall well-being. Diabetes is characterised by abnormally high blood glucose levels, which are the result of either impaired insulin secretion or impaired physiologic effects, or both. Many tissues, including the eyes, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, and nerves, can be permanently damaged or dysfunctional due to diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes are the two types of diabetes (T2D). Diabetics with type 1 diabetes tend to be younger people, with the majority of them being under the age of 30. Increased thirst and frequent urination are the most common symptoms, as are elevated blood glucose levels. Oral drugs alone are ineffective in treating this kind of diabetes, hence insulin therapy is essential. Middle-aged and older adults are more likely to develop type-2 diabetes, which is frequently linked to obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, arteriosclerosis, and other conditions. Implementing a machine learning model that can quickly uncover the principles for predicting diabetes mellitus in individuals depending on their health status is discussed in this research. There must be an IBM cloud deployment of the model before it can be utilised as an API in web app development. The User Interface will display the model's prediction.

AB  - Nowadays, chronic insomnia is a critical problem of homo-sapiens. An increase in workload and tension in life led to the development of sleep stress. Sleep stress can damage human beings in a physical, psychological, and social manner. Sickness in the stomach, tension, and frayed nerves while sleeping are the most frequent symptoms of sleep stress. Sleep stress can lead to cardiac infarction, depression, senile psychosis, gastrointestinal problems, diabetes, obesity, and emphysematous. This paper primarily focuses on the classification of sleep stress levels using standard machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Radial basis function Supported-Vector Classifier (RBF-SVC), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Linear Support-Vector Classifier (L-SVC), Naive Bayes (NB), Support-Vector Classifier (SVC), on the scaled dataset using Standard Scaling. LR, KNN, and SVC outperformed all the other machine learning classifiers in terms of performance metrics.

AB  - Due to a shift in lifestyle, many young people are currently suffering from heart attacks, diabetes, and obesity. Because of work schedules, the sickness rate has grown since the covid epidemic. To stop this issue, early discovery is necessary. As a result, the constructed model will forecast the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart attacks based on user input from their respective location. An individual's health risk assessment is very important in determining any health conditions that require urgent care. This makes it possible for someone to recognize potential health dangers and take the appropriate safety precautions. Thus, the goal of this proposed system is to develop a user-friendly Artificial Intelligence driven health risk assessment application that would give users a platform to do basic health risk assessments. Based on the user input, Machine Learning based health predictors generate the health analysis report and alert the user with proper guidance. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, Voting Ensemble and Decision Tree algorithms are used for accurate prediction of disease. The proposed application is cost effective since it uses a couple of features.

AB  - The prevalence of heart diseases is rising quickly throughout the world, which has an impact on both the world economy and public health. According to the recent statistical survey reports, the increasing mortality rate is due to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, the use of tobacco, obesity, and an inconsistent pulse rate. It is difficult and time-consuming to investigate the various variations of these factors and their impact on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Therefore, it is necessary to use modern approaches to diagnose the disease early and minimize the mortality rate. The fields of machine learning and data mining have a wide research dimension and various novel techniques that could help in the prediction of CAD in its early stages and identify their patterns and behaviors in a huge amount of data. The results of such predictions will aid the clinical staff in decision making and early diagnosis. In such a scenario, we proposed a quantum version of the Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCQ-CNN) for Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) classification. The proposed model evaluates the quantum circuit-based technique that was inspired by convolutional neural networks, a very successful machine learning model. This method provides  $O(log (n))$  depth for  $n$  qubits, reducing the number of parameters and allowing for effective training and testing of real quantum devices. The model has been evaluated by considering the IHD dataset after the data has been cleaned and filtered through the Maximally Relevant Minimally Redundancy (MRMR) filter. For dimension reduction, a Support Vector Machine along with Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) has been considered. Initially, the model is tested with 20% of the whole dataset and gets the promising results of a testing accuracy of 84.6% with a testing loss of 0.28. By taking into account the same optimal parameters, the proposed model outcomes are compared to those of the classical Optimized Convolution Neural Network (Optimized-CNN) and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) models. Comparing the model’s competency to that of earlier published quantum models yields improvements in accuracy of 8.6%, 12.6%, 3.5%, and 1.8% respectively.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which is mostly related to conditions like obesity and diabetes, is a significant cause of death and suffering in the modern day. As of 2017, the global prevalence of CKD reached a staggering 843.6 million individuals. Prompt identification of CKD stages holds paramount importance in mitigating potential complications including hypertension, anemia, and neurological disorders. Leveraging the power of machine learning, early detection of CKD is pursued, predominantly through binary and multiclass classification approaches. The repertoire of utilized models encompasses XgBoost, Ada Boosting, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Extra Tree Classifier. To foster a comprehensive understanding of the data and prepare features effectively, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and label encoding techniques are harnessed. Ada Boosting, with recursive feature elimination, outperforms other models like RF, XgBoosting, Extra Tree Classifier, and DT. The study's emphasis is on accurate stage prediction in CKD diagnosis. This research contributes to advancing precise CKD stage prediction methods. The findings highlight Ada Boosting's effectiveness in enhancing CKD diagnostic capabilities.

AB  - Recent studies say that heart diseases are the major threat to humans. The diagnosis of the disease is obtained by making predictions from the patient's medical details. A minor error in predicting or diagnosis the results of heart related diseases can cause several problems. To address the issue, several researchers used the hospital data or patients' information for data mining and statistical tools for helping the health care system in the diagnosis of heart diseases. For making people aware of heart disease, a prediction model is required for early detection. The prediction model uses the training data and predicts the results by using several machine learning techniques. Using this training data, the testing of the other data is done precisely. In this research, for the prediction of the results from the given data, machine learning algorithms are used for model development. The prediction includes accuracy of each algorithm. By using machine learning techniques, the correlation between various features present in the dataset is also identified in the research while performing the experiment. The framework makes use of 13 features, including ones related to age, gender, obesity, blood pressure, cholesterol, and cp as various attributes to generate the classifiers. Using these features the output of these classifiers reveals that the accuracy of each algorithm and assists in predicting risk factors related to heart diseases and gives which is best suitable technique for producing the best predictions.

AB  - Nowadays, people are increasingly concerned for their health as being healthy is regarded as a profitable investment. Obesity is one of the most common health problems that leads to multiple diseases. We work with the team that developed a mobile application to encourage users to change their eating and activity behaviors to improve their health based on a virtual competition platform. Participants are required to upload a weight-in photo to verify their weight before the challenge. Manually verifying these images can be time-consuming and error-prone due to the large number of images in each competition. In this study, we proposed an image classification approach to help screen incorrect images of the weight-in photo for the virtual competition. The image augmentation techniques were applied to the training images before being input into the classification model. Since the goal is to deploy the model in a mobile application, the suitable model must be small and efficient enough for use in a limited resources environment. Therefore, VGGNet-16 and MobileNet-V2 were selected as the classification models. The experimental results show that the model could learn from the preprocessed images and obtain satisfactory classification results from pre-trained VGGNet-16 with the highest accuracy and F1-score of 95.00% and 95.23%, respectively. MobileNet-V2 inference time was approximately 10 times faster but the performance was lower with the highest accuracy and F1-score of 93.00% and 93.32%, respectively.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is a major health concern worldwide, with an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year. It encompasses a range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. These diseases are often associated with a range of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, and genetic predisposition. Data analysis and machine learning have emerged as powerful tools for predicting and preventing cardiovascular disease. By analysing large and complex datasets of medical records, researchers can identify patterns and risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. Machine learning models can help identify important features in the data that are predictive of heart disease outcomes, and can be used to develop accurate and reliable predictive models. Moreover, data analysis can help identify disparities and biases in cardiovascular disease outcomes across different populations and regions. This research aims to develop a machine-learning model for predicting cardiovascular disease risk using benchmark datasets. Various imputation techniques, including Mean, Median, Most Frequent, KNNI, and the proposed risk prediction model, are compared in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The CatBoost classification algorithm is used for developing the proposed model, achieving an accuracy of 91% for the Hungarian dataset. This research provides valuable insights into the use of machine learning and data analysis for predicting cardiovascular disease and improving healthcare outcomes.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are increasingly becoming a silent killer with over 17.9 million deaths annually due to ischaemic heart disease and strokes. Additionally, that number is set to rise at a rapid pace as obesity rates and unhealthy eating habits increase worldwide. Cardiovascular diseases are quite well hidden among individuals and mostly remain undetected until they strike, with a high fatality rate. An active testing protocol must be established to ensure that all such problems are detected and mitigated at an earlier stage in order to improve the quality of life and life expectancy of individuals suffering from cardiovascular diseases.This generates a large patient dataset, and to accurately prepare models to handle the automated detection, they have to be trained on an existing data set which was chosen to a combination of 4 existing data sets from the USA, Hungary, and Switzerland, where each has 13 features and 1 target class which needs to be accurately analyzed and predicted to ensure that large scale checkups can occur without burdening the healthcare system. In the present study, the authors have worked to perform a series of exploratory data analysis, and base line predictions via 15 varying Machine Learning models to understand the type of models that perform better and can be utilized for further optimization.

AB  - Even if people are rushing to go to work and have a hectic schedule, they are taking good care of themselves till symptoms appear. Obesity and weight increment are two attributes that affect working on the personal satisfaction across the world. The Internet of Things (IoT), which interconnects, distinguishes, recognizes, and processes information between gadgets or administrations, assumes a basic part in accomplishing the common objective. The Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare gives us the ability to track, analyses, diagnose, and manage various overweight and obesity diseases. Also, provide weight-loss and obesity prevention solutions. Because there are a limited number of items that may be employed in IoT, another technology, such as machine learning, is being presented to achieve the above-mentioned benefits. People who are at high risk for cardiovascular illness may also be at risk for renal disease, which can be diagnosed and treated using medical information from the past. However, CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) is a condition that has no analytic signs and is challenging to find, distinguish, and forestall, and it can forever hurt the wellbeing framework, along these lines AI is being utilized to track down it monastery for therapy forecast and examination. The principal objective of this examination is to foster a prescient model for CKD and coronary illness information utilizing open source Python modules. Machine learning algorithms can be used for prediction, and exactness is determined by comparing various algorithms including such K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as well as Fast-Recurrent Neural Networks (FRNN). This method is used to forecast a dataset derived from a patient's medical history. The expected number lets us know whether an individual will foster persistent kidney illness or simply not in view of the amount of potassium in their blood.

AB  - Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows for a neural network model to simultaneously train and predict on multiple related tasks/targets using a shared core network and task-specific branching layers. The related nature of the tasks can be exploited by MTL to regularize the model and its use has been shown to increase performance in all tasks. Imbalanced complexity in tasks leads to MTL models being dominated by a few tasks, which cause conflicting loss function parameters and poor training, resulting in generalized but unspecific models. Medical healthcare records (MHRs) taken on events such as pregnancy often track multiple related targets such maternal morbidity factors (i.e., Sudden Maternal Morbidity, Hemorrhage, Preeclampsia) and long-term health outcomes (i.e., cardiovascular disease, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, post-partum depression, substance use), which serve as an excellent testbed for the MTL models. This study seeks to develop solutions to task imbalance and interference for MTL systems and demonstrate their efficacy compared to traditional single-task models on a prenatal MHR dataset.

AB  - The pandemic of diabetes mellitus has spread to both industrialized and developing nations. In India, there will likely be 100 million people with diabetes by the year 2030. Due to genetic predisposition, a poor lifestyle that leads to obesity, decreased Insulin resistance, and adverse consequences brought on by urbanization, diabetes is the most prevalent kind of disease in adults between the ages of 41 and 60. Lack of understanding about diabetes has a number of harmful effects on health, so raising awareness of the disease is essential. A diabetes prediction portal has been created as a solution to this issue, and it is used to produce a dichotomous result. Machine learning is utilized to train the data on the PIMA Indians diabetes dataset, and k nearest neighbours produced the maximum accuracy.

AB  - Mild asthma symptoms can be easily mistaken for those of other health conditions, e.g., allergy and obesity-related symptoms. This might lead to delayed diagnosis and wrong treatment, risking complications and even permanent lung damage. In this study, we introduce a pioneering method for asthma detection. By integrating machine learning (ML) algorithms and advanced audio analysis techniques, the proposed method rapidly and accurately detects asthmatic patients from audio clips containing vocal recordings without the need for dedicated medical devices. By utilising various ML algorithms, the examination of audio clips analyses diverse asthma-related airflow control and respiratory aspects. To strengthen the reliability and accuracy of the model, feature selection algorithms are integrated into the proposed method to address overfitting concerns and retain the most informative features. The model evaluation employs various performance metrics, e.g., accuracy and confusion matrix, to ensure a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of asthma detection. Another novelty of the proposed method is the inclusion of established data analytics tools, e.g., Spotfire, H2O and Sklearn. This approach marks a paradigm shift compared to existing methods, which results in a simplified and more effective asthma detection method. Examining the overall results, vowel pronunciation with its full set of 14 features using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm on the H2O tool yielded the highest accuracy of 92%. Moreover, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) with correlation-based feature selection (CFS) and customised hyperparameters yielded accuracy of 85% respectively. The proposed method contributes to the advancement of ML theory in healthcare applications, providing a practical framework for the implementation of asthma detection while demonstrating superior performance compared to existing.

AB  - Diabetes affects a large number of people in modern culture. Individuals must keep track of food calories and total calories consumed daily to maintain a balanced diet. Type 2 diabetes is a devastating metabolic illness that may manifest in many symptoms and complications throughout the body. In the modern day, diabetics may be found throughout all age groups in society. The increased number of reported diabetes patients may be attributed to different causes, including but not limited to harmful or chemical components blended into the food, obesity, working culture and improper diet plan, atypical lifestyle, consuming food habits, and environmental variables. As a result, saving human life requires a proper diagnosis of diabetes. When used in the healthcare industry, machine learning techniques may help doctors foresee the onset of diabetes and other complications. This research proposes the Diabetic Food Recommendation System (DFR-HL) to identify diabetes and advice patients on managing their condition via diet (DFRS). The datasets are normalized using a standard scalar with an improved Decision Tree (IDT), and the feature is selected using a Random forest. Finally, the classification has been done with Hybrid (CNN with Resnet50) DL algorithms. The experimental results are compared with performance metrics.

AB  - Social presence has been known to impact eating behavior among people with obesity; however, the dual study of eating behavior and social presence in real-world settings is challenging due to the inability to reliably confirm the co-occurrence of these important factors. High-resolution video cameras can detect timing while providing visual confirmation of behavior; however, their potential to capture all-day behavior is limited by short battery lifetime and lack of autonomy in detection. Low-resolution infrared (IR) sensors have shown promise in automating human behavior detection; however, it is unknown if IR sensors contribute to behavior detection when combined with RGB cameras. To address these challenges, we designed and deployed a low-power, and low-resolution RGB video camera, in conjunction with a low-resolution IR sensor, to test a learned model's ability to detect eating and social presence. We evaluated our system in the wild with 10 participants with obesity; our models displayed slight improvement when detecting eating (5%) and significant improvement when detecting social presence (44%) compared with using a video-only approach. We analyzed device failure scenarios and their implications for future wearable camera design and machine learning pipelines. Lastly, we provide guidance for future studies using low-cost RGB and IR sensors to validate human behavior with context.

AB  - Liver disease has caused a serious concern in India and is rising similar to diabetes, about 3.17% of Indians die due to this disease. It is always a tedious task to identify liver disease in the initial stages, which may lead to life-threatening diseases such as liver cirrhosis, cancer, etc. The main reasons behind it are alcoholism, obesity, hepatitis B and C, etc. Therefore, there is a need for enabling automatic detection in the early stages which in turn leads to diminishing the death rates. This study proposes novel machine learning and neural network models to unfold this problem. Here, the Indian Liver Patient Dataset, a UCI repository with 583 samples is used. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)and Machine Learning (ML)models such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine are applied along with hyperparameter tuning to get the best model for accurate liver disease prediction. F1-score, accuracy, recall and precision with and without feature selection are analyzed. In this study, the F1-score of LR is the highest at 83.85% when no feature selection is applied. ANN and SVM topped 83.38% with the F1-score exhibiting the highest accuracy of 73.57%.

AB  - One of the major causes of death worldwide are Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Elevated levels of cholesterol, blood pressure, blood glucose, and obesity are some of the parameters that can cause heart problems. Preventing premature deaths begins with detecting those who are at a high risk of CVDs and making sure that they are given adequate treatment. This paper aims to diagnose heart disease given certain health parameters. Authors have implemented an ensemble method, stacking, for classification in this paper. Different combinations of machine learning (ML) models have been used as the base-model. Logistic Regression has been used as the meta-model. Authors have used Accuracy, F14 Score, and MCC value to test and compare the models to find out which combination for the base model gives the best accuracy. Authors obtained an accuracy of 86.55% using a combination of k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Trees Classification (DT), as opposed to an accuracy of 82.3%, 84.8%, and 79.8% for each of the models used individually.

AB  - Modern people’s hectic schedules are a direct result of the ways they live and the responsibilities they have at work. On the other hand, maintaining a healthy lifestyle demands consistent physical exertion. Obesity is a result of people not paying attention to what they eat. As a result of modern living, obesity is on the rise. As a result, in order to maintain a healthy weight, people pick their food and exercise habits accordingly. People should know how many calories they consume and how many calories they burn. Calorie counts are easy to get online or on product labels, so it’s not hard to keep track of one’s calorie intake. There aren’t many tools available to help you keep track of the calories you burn. To keep up with the hectic pace of modern life and the constant search for shortcuts, we built a system that uses machine learning to track post-workout calorie burn and development. By taking a few attributes as input, this system can approximate the calories burned, which will show daily growth and motivate people to exercise more. This paper presents an innovative ML model for accurate calorie prediction; it’s called the Improved Learning Model for Calorie Prediction (ILMCP). To test how well it works, the authors cross-validate it with the traditional Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. As a result, it is the quickest approach and may be utilized for object identification in real-time. Next, we’ll apply the ILMCP algorithm to the picture for segmentation. Foreground extraction with little to no user input requires it. Following picture segmentation, we use the probing object’s known volume to determine the food item’s volume. Once the volume has been determined, the food item’s mass may be determined using formulae. Then, the connection between weight and calories can be used to compute the food item’s calories.
