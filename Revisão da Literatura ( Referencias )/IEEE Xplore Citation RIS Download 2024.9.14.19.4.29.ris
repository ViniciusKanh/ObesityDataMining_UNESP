AB  - Recent study reveals that the mortality rate due to chronic diseases like heart disease is increasing year on year. Predicting heart disease at an early stage is posing a challenge to the healthcare industry due to multiple contributory factors like high blood pressure, uncontrolled cholesterol, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, alcohol consumption, etc. An accurate and effective diagnosis of heart disease at an early stage can prevent fatal complications such as heart attacks and strokes significantly. This research will not only help the medical fraternity, medico research scientists, and insurance agencies to assess the probability of heart disease but also help the common man to prevent hospitalization and reduce the expenses for the diagnosis significantly. In the past, multiple studies have been conducted on heart disease prediction using regular human vital parameters. We have expanded the research with family hereditary data of the person and by effectively using this feature we have evaluated model performance changes. We have used machine learning classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree along with ensemble techniques like Random Forest with boosting algorithms like Ada Boost, XG Boost, etc. We evaluated the model performance with various metrics like precision, F1-score, and recall with more importance to the accuracy of the prediction.

AB  - Diabetes is one of the most devastating diseases and affects many people. Diabetes can be caused by a variety of causes, including ageing, obesity, inactivity, genetics, a poor diet, high blood pressure, and others. Diabetes increases the likelihood of developing several illnesses, including heart disease, renal disease, stroke, eye problems, nerve damage, etc. The information needed to diagnose diabetes is currently gathered through a variety of tests used in hospitals, and the diagnosis is then used to determine the best course of treatment. The healthcare sector has a considerable application for machine learning (ML). Databases in the healthcare sector are very vast. Big datasets can be examined using ML techniques to find hidden information and patterns, allowing one to learn from the data and predict outcomes properly. Using the existing methods, the forecast’s accuracy is not very good. In this study, we proposed an early diabetes prediction model that incorporates several extrinsic characteristics that contribute to the development of diabetes together with more widely used measures like polyuria, weight loss, polyphagia, visual blurring, alopecia, obesity, etc. The Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Logistic Regression (LOR), the Boosted Tree (BOT), and the Bagged Tree (BAT) are four different classifiers that are utilized in this paper to predict diabetes early on. The device’s performance is assessed in terms of accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and f-measure. Results show that among the classifiers, BAT has the highest accuracy, at 98%.

AB  - Heart diseases are prevalent in today's world due to many factors like lipid disorder (hypercholesterolemia), corpulence (obesity), increase in triglycerides levels (lipids obtained from esterification fatty acids to glycerol), hypertension, etc. It is estimated that nearly 18 million lives are affected yearly due to various heart diseases. Early detection of such diseases could help save several lives. In the proposed system, heart failure prediction is estimated using the combination of Gradient boost detection and decision trees. The parallel handling approach is used for feature processing to speed up the results and for optimal performance. The generation and discrimination approach are used to verify the outcomes concerning other algorithms and pseudo-codes. This paper uses the data file from the University of California, Irvine Intelligent Systems Repository to test the results. It is observed from several experiments that it provides optimal performance compared to the remaining predictors in the context of f1 score, recall, and accuracy. The ROC curve of Gradient Boost provides a higher deviation for low false positives. The Gradient Boost shows a 0.919 ROC value and 92 % of accuracy with an F1 score of 0.928 and a recall of 0.934.

AB  - Diabetes is a critical condition that affects a large number of people. It can be caused by age, obesity, lack of exercise, genetic diabetes, lifestyle, poor diet, high blood pressure, and other factors. People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, eye problems, nerve damage, and more. The current practice of the hospital is to gather the necessary information for the diagnosis of diabetes using various tests, and then to provide appropriate treatment according to the diagnosis. Big Data Analytics is important in the healthcare industry. Data stored in the healthcare industry is huge in size. By using large data statistics, one can scan large data sets to reveal hidden information and trends, enabling one to obtain data and predictably produce results accordingly. The classification and prediction accuracy of the current method is not very good. In this study, we present a predictive model of diabetes for advanced diabetes classification that includes a few external variables that cause diabetes in addition to normal components such as glucose, BMI, age, insulin, and so on. Compared to the old database, the new database improves the accuracy of categories. In addition, a diabetic pipeline model was developed for the purpose of improving the accuracy of the sections.

AB  - The global obesity epidemic has persisted for many years, resulting from prevalent dietary disorders that expose individuals to a multitude of health risks. Juggling the demands of a working adult’s life while trying to manage one’s diet can prove to be quite a challenge. Machine Learning (ML) stands as an incredibly potent and indispensable technology in our contemporary world.The system will have a significant emphasis on calorie and nutrient calculation within food items, and it sets itself apart from existing systems by offering full automation, eliminating the need for users to manually input data. Users will find the process incredibly straightforward, merely requiring them to capture an image of their food and provide it as input to the system. The initial phase of the system involves determining an individual’s recommended calorie intake based on their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This calculated daily calorie goal is then continually monitored and presented through Augmented Reality (AR). If the individual successfully adheres to their daily calorie target, the system sends an achievement notification to acknowledge their progress. However, should the individual surpass their calorie goal, the system responds by displaying a pop-up AR window suggesting suitable exercises to help offset the excess calorie consumption. This approach combines personalized calorie management with real-time AR feedback to support users in maintaining their desired dietary goals and overall health.

AB  - In healthcare management, a large number of multidisciplinary statistics on those affected are generated from scientific reports, physician records. However, the assessment of health parameters and the prediction of subsequent fitness situations is only at the informational stage. In this case, a series of probabilistic statistical mechanisms are designed and correlation evaluation of these cumulative statistics is performed. Finally, a random prediction version of using a knowledge-gathering utility about a set of rules called Random Forests and Neural Networks designed to predict fitness of mostly maximal correlators based on current physical popularity. Within this framework, the health prevalence of patients is expected mainly based on their BMI (body mass index) statistics. These statistics are analyzed and are based primarily on what the reputation of the physical condition of the person concerned is expected to be. Performance evaluation of the proposed protocols is achieved through well-sized simulations.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal disorder that presents a diagnostic challenge due to its varied manifestations. Early detection of PCOS is crucial for timely intervention and management. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning-based approach for the early diagnosis of PCOS, leveraging demographic data to train a model that achieves high accuracy. Our study highlights the significance of data scaling and normalization in improving the model's performance. The results demonstrate that ensemble methods, specifically Random Forest and Extra Trees Classifier, outper-form traditional methods, exhibiting an accuracy of 94 % for PCOS detection. Feature selection analysis reveals that clinical and demographic features, including age, body mass index (BMI), and hormonal levels, play a pivotal role in PCOS detection, with the combination of features yielding superior performance. Model optimization through parameter fine-tuning and experimentation with different ensemble methods enhance the models' predictive capability. Our proposed methodology addresses the limitations of existing algorithms, ensuring robust and accurate PCOS diagnosis. The implementation of our approach demonstrates efficiency in achieving high accuracy and performance for PCOS detection. Therefore, the future for early diagnosis of PCOS with this innovative and compatible machine-learning approach is promising, offering the potential to revolutionize PCOS diagnosis and aid in timely intervention and personalized management strategies. Thus, machine learning is a valuable adjunct to clinical examination, hormonal assays, and ultrasound, as it holds great promise as a powerful tool for early detection and diagnosis of PCOS, enhancing healthcare outcomes for women with this disorder.

AB  - Obesity, a complex condition involving genetic, behavioral, socioeconomic, and environmental factors, poses significant health risks and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for individuals with severe obesity, resulting in substantial weight loss. However, weight regain remains a significant challenge in the long-term after surgery. This study focuses on analyzing movement patterns of patients who have undergone bariatric surgery using wearable accelerometry to investigate the relationships between movement behaviors, body composition, and weight regain. An intelligent system employing machine learning techniques was utilized to predict total fat percentage and visceral fat. Results indicate that Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Gradient Boosting models show promising performance in predicting fat percentage and visceral fat. Furthermore, the study reveals associations between age, sedentary behavior, post-surgery BMI, day-and night-time movement, and body composition following bariatric surgery. These findings contribute to a better understanding of factors influencing weight regain and may inform future interventions to promote long-term weight loss maintenance in bariatric surgery patients.

AB  - Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are proven to be widespread in the population, often resulting in mortality. As per recent reports, the dramatic rise in heart attacks and cardiovascular illnesses is attributed, in part, to post-COVID symptoms, obesity, lifestyle changes brought on by the pandemic, and intense work pressure coupled with stress and hypertension. Early identification is the key to lowering the rising mortality rates from CVD. However, with limited medical facilities and lack of specialized doctors, it is difficult to continuously monitor the patients and provide consultations. At the same time, the amount of data acquired by the medical industry is so vast that it might be difficult to observe and interpret at times. Using the same data to train a machine learning algorithm, a prediction model can be developed. Such a prediction system can be effective for both doctors and patients. This research studies the different cardiovascular diseases and the risk factors. This investigates some of the most extensively used machine learning algorithms for predicting heart disease utilizing medical data and historical information. In this article, we have compared primary machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression and SVM

AB  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a major health concern amongst a majority of women. Many issues, including infertility, acne, hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles, and obesity, may result from it. It could also result in type 2 diabetes, endometrial cancer, heart problems, and high blood pressure. Early diagnosis of PCOS may help prevent and treat such health concerns. This paper proposes using ultrasound imaging of the follicles to extract vital details about the ovary, such as the kind of cyst, the variety of follicles present, and how the size of the follicle reacts to hormonal imbalance. Using image processing techniques, morphological operations, and machine learning, the models identify the valuable characteristics in the ultrasound pictures, highlight them, and then build a suitable classification model for the same. On using transfer learning models such as VGG-16 and Inception-V3, an accuracy of 100% each is obtained.

AB  - Stress is one of the mental health issues that people face today. In reality stress is the primary cause of many conditions, such as heart disease, migraines, infertility, obesity, insomnia, and a host of others. In this scenario, stress prediction is crucial at an early stage so that we can protect ourselves against future issues. For identifying the stress, method of connecting sensors to multiple data gathering units using traditional technologies typically involved electrodes, wires, and sensors, was uncomfortable. Smart watches, on the other hand, are designed to be worn on the wrist and have sensors integrated into them that can measure heart rate and activity levels. Here, we report on our smart watch's highest level of stress prediction accuracy. We have used random forests, decision trees, support vector machines, naive bayes, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbor models with k-fold cross-validation and voting ensemble learning to predict stress using data from smart watches (Fit bit). The support vector machine model had a binary class prediction of stress accuracy of 94°, which was the highest. Our findings suggest that the support vector machine and voting ensemble combination may be more effective at identifying stress using smart watches. Our study closes a variety of methodological shortcomings in previous studies on the automatic stress prediction using smart watches. It has also been noted that the model performs better when ensemble learning techniques are used.

AB  - In today's world, where people are leading busy lives with changes in their lifestyle and work commitments, it has become difficult to prioritize regular physical activity to maintain good health. The lack of physical activity and unhealthy food habits can lead to various health issues, including obesity. To maintain a healthy lifestyle, it is crucial to balance diet and exercise, and knowing calorie intake and burn is essential. While tracking calorie intake is relatively easy, monitoring calorie burn is challenging due to the limited devices available. This research aims to develop a model using a Random Forest Regressor machine learning algorithm to accurately predict the number of calories burned. The model was trained on more than 15,000 data points and demonstrated a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 8.3. However, with additional data, the accuracy of the model can improve over time. The primary goal of this research is to develop an accurate and efficient model that can aid people in maintaining a healthy lifestyle by accurately predicting the number of calories burned during physical activity.

AB  - Due to its substantial effects on society, efforts to enhance heart disease diagnosis and treatment have increased. Through data mining and the archiving of medical records, improved patient management is now possible thanks to the fusion of technology and medical diagnoses. Understanding the interaction between risk factors in the histories of patients and their impact on their prospects for heart disease is of utmost importance. This study aims to accurately predict cardiac disease by analyzing various data elements from patients. The selection and feature extraction methods are the most efficient choices for prediction system for heart disease. The following variables, such as age, sex, occupation, smoking, obesity, diet, exercise, mental stress levels, type of chest pain, history of chest pain, pressure, ECG, and results, have all been identified as significant factors in diagnosing heart disease. Various machine learning methods, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes (NB), K-nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were utilized to analyze the heart disease dataset. These datasets consisted of one with all features and another with only selected features. The objective was to compare the performance of these methods and determine which ones yielded accurate predictions. The results revealed that random forest, using the chosen features, outperformed other artificial intelligence algorithms, including those using all input features, achieving a maximum accuracy rate of 90%. As a support framework for predicting cardiac disease in its early stages, the suggested approach shows promise. This study advances the prognosis of cardiac disease, enables prompt therapies, and enhances patient outcomes by fusing the strength of data-driven AI algorithms with thorough feature selection.

AB  - Regular physical exercise can improve lung function and asthma control, especially in individuals with asthma who are overweight or obese. Nevertheless, being active or exercising could be a risk factor for asthma exacerbations. Monitoring physiological signals during exercise may help to detect potential worsening in asthma and could be used to help persons with asthma to adjust their exercise. Our goal was to determine whether small airway narrowing due to exercise could be predicted using conveniently recorded data including participant’s demographics and respiratory-related signals. In this study, 10 adults with asthma and body mass index (BMI) over 25 kg/m2 were asked to cycle for 10 minutes in a room at 20°C. During exercise, the respiratory signals were recorded using inductance plethysmography on the chest and abdomen. Before and after exercise, small airway narrowing was assessed based on respiratory impedance measured by forced oscillation technique. From the chest respiratory signal and demographic data, a total of four features have been obtained in the time domain. To detect airway narrowing, five different machine learning classifiers were fine-tuned and evaluated using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation approach. The best model had an accuracy of 77.01%, a recall of 82.69%, a specificity of 68.57%, a precision of 79.63%, and an F1 score of 81.13%. These results provide proof of concept that technologies with embedded respiratory signal monitoring may be able to predict airway narrowing during exercise in individuals with asthma, particularly in the overweight or obese population.

AB  - Health-care organizations collect huge amounts of data, which might include certain hidden facts that could be utilized to make better decisions. Some sophisticated data mining methods are utilized to provide suitable findings and make good data judgements. In this study, affinity propagation clustering & neural networks are utilized to build an adequate heart disease predicting system for anticipating the risk level of heart disease. The algorithm predicts using 15 medical criteria such as age, gender, blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. The EHDPS predicts a patient's risk of developing heart disease. It enables the generation of a large amount of data, such as associations between medical indicators related to heart disease as well as patterns. A multilayer neural network containing back propagation has been employed as the training approach. Clustering has been performed using affinity propagation. ANN algorithm has been used. Certain parameters such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Recall and F-score has been calculated. The results demonstrate that the proposed diagnostic approach may properly predict the risk level of heart diseases.

AB  - For gait analysis, an IMU sensor was mounted on the knee and gait related data was collected. Various gait parameters such as gait time, stance swing ratio, heel strike, and toe off can be extracted from the dataset. To explore the relationship between gait parameters and individual gait characteristics, we analyzed the gait patterns of normal and obese people were analyzed based on BMI (Body Mass Index). To apply it to a classification model of machine learning, different gait cycles between subjects were normalized. Gait data was collected from eight subjects in their 20s. Using this dataset, we applied a logistic regression model, and obtained the classification accuracy of 92%. We also investigated the correlation between BMI and gait parameters and found that, the correlation between BMI and cadence was -0.66.

AB  - Older adults commonly require special care and falling is a major reason for hospital admission. Identifying the cause of falls would help enable precautionary measures to be taken, which may reduce both injury and medical expenses. This study focuses on understanding underlying medical conditions or medicines associated with an increased risk of falls. Two datasets, one with trauma patient details and the other with fall-related admitted patient details, were analyzed to determine whether any relationship exists between falls and any underlying medical conditions and associated medications. Data visualization techniques and machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVC, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes) have been used to study the cause of falls and whether they can be anticipated prior to their occurrence.

AB  - Obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and depression have all been linked to insufficient sleep. Analysis of one's sleep habits using one's smartphone has gained popularity as a possible solution. In this paper, we provide a framework for analyzing sleep habits using mobile devices. Because of their widespread availability and extensive sensor suite, cellphones are being use in sleep research. Motion and orientation sensors and audio recorders are used in sleep analysis. Both head and body motions are tracked by the gyroscope and accelerometer, respectively. The microphone is sensitive enough to pick up noises like snoring. Approaches to sleep analysis on smartphones range widely. Sensor data may be analyzed using machine learning algorithms. These systems can distinguish between light, deep, and REM sleep by analyzing data from motion and sound sensors. Gather information about your sleep using surveys or questionnaires like the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Analysis of sleep patterns with a mobile device has several benefits. It's a simple and non-invasive way to study how you sleep. Second, it offers continuous monitoring of sleep, which might lead to the identification and resolution of sleep disorders. Third, it may provide objective sleep data for the diagnosis of sleep disorders and the development of individualized treatment plans. Analysis of one's slumber using a smartphone might shed light on our sleeping habits and encourage healthy ones. Machine learning algorithms and questionnaires are two methods for analyzing sleep quality on a smartphone. Smartphone-based sleep studies are easy to implement and conduct, and they provide reliable, objective information on one's nightly slumber.

AB  - Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body’s ability to process glucose is impaired due to insufficient insulin production or utilization. This can result in high blood sugar levels and other health issues. Since the majority of our country’s population are not conscious about their lifestyle and are unaware of the complications and casualties that diabetes can lead to if it is not examined timely, assessing their risk for diabetes is an important step in prevention and early detection. Assessing one’s diabetes risk prior to medical diagnosis is crucial to enable timely intervention and management of the disease. Our paper intends to provide such a solution that would help detect the disease risk beforehand. We selected two diabetes datasets: PIMA Indian and Sylhet dataset for evaluating ten different models, namely-Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Adaboost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, and Multilayer perceptron. We applied Grid Search and Stratified K-fold cross-validation to asses model’s performance. Our goal is to determine the best-performing model for predicting diabetes. From the analysis, Random Forest outperformed in PIMA Indian Dataset with 84.21% accuracy and Gradient Boost outperformed in Sylhet dataset with 98.85% accuracy. So, for the two different featured datasets Random Forest and Gradient Boost scored highest as the best-predicting models.

AB  - One of the most life-threatening diseases that causes human beings to suffer is heart disease. According to WHO report, more than 17.9 million people are affected and raised to death due to cardiovascular diseases around the globe. Many factors that influence the disease are high blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, etc. An earlier diagnosis of the disease helps to change the lifestyle and the start of treatment helps to save the human being life. Machine learning techniques are used in this work to analyze heart disease effectively. The purpose of the research is to perform efficient heart disease analysis using ML models. Machine learning is a sub-category of AI that makes decisions based on past and historical data. ML can be sub-classified into 3 types. In this research, supervised ML models are considered for analysis. In supervised ML models: K-NN, SVM, and RF are applied. The experimental approach is conducted with the heart disease dataset with three different ML models. The results demonstrate that the RF approach has the best performance across all metrics, subsequent to the SVM model and the KNN model. Among the three models, the RF model has the greatest sensitivity (0.8654), precision (0.8182), specificity (0.7674), and accuracy (0.82105) compared to other approaches in this particular heart disease dataset.

AB  - Breast cancer is one of the major causes of fatalities in women across the globe, necessitating early diagnosis and detection for successful treatment. Scientists have pinpointed numerous risk factors for breast cancer such as obesity and sex hormones. Machine learning prediction systems have employed diverse data types, like genetic profiles, clinical data, and X-ray images, to foresee the risk of breast cancer. To eliminate any unnecessary or superfluous attributes from high-dimensional datasets, algorithms for feature selection have been applied. This research proposes a composite machine learning model integrating five models: Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression with Lasso Regularization, Logistic Regression with Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Feature selection methodologies employed are based on the K-Means clustering oriented feature importance measure. The Coimbra breast cancer dataset, composed of 116 data points and 10 characteristics, is used for training and assessing the models on their predictive abilities. According to the study’s outcomes, the Support Vector Machine model demonstrates the greatest effectiveness for the dataset when used with the proposed feature selection, whereas Gradient Boosting and Random Forest are efficacious models without feature selection.

AB  - It is known that characteristics of community food environments (CFEs) affect the health of populations. At present, no literature supports an effective and efficient method to approach the study of CFEs at both local and regional scales in a comprehensive manner. In Latin America, research is focused the most on the study of food supply stores and their relationship with health outcomes, generally at the local scale. This paper aims to present a complete review and proposal of the change of scale of CFEs problem, taking as an example the geospatial analysis of the food environment of localities with more than 5000 inhabitants in the province of Cordoba. According to 2010 National Census, 95 localities were selected in Cordoba with a population greater than or equal to 5000 inhabitants. Obesity data were extracted from the first National Nutrition and Health Survey (2005). Based on the state-of-the-art, some indicators were selected to characterize the three dimensions (Political, Environmental, and Individual) of CFEs proposed by Glanz et al. [1]. Pearson´s correlation between indicators of CFE was calculated in R software (p< 0.05). Based on the approach proposed by Alvarez DiFino et al. [2], maps were developed in RGB colors to show the conformation of CFEs based on their three dimensions. Finally, an XGBoost model was run to identify the most influential variables on obesity, and to determine the relative importance of each variable within the model, SHapley Additive exPlanations library was used. A mild positive correlation was observed between the number of preschoolers with obesity and socioeconomic status (r=0.30) and a mild negative correlation between the number of obese preschoolers and health vulnerability index (r=-0.30). The generated RGB map shows clearly that the south of the province (localities with higher importance of individual dimension) showed a lower number of cases of obesity compared to the north- northwest of the territory (cities with a higher environmental component and a lower political dimension). Variables and their values, most influential in the obesity modelling were the higher average vegetation index, followed by a lower level of chronic poverty and a higher level of risk of food insecurity. The methods applied to study the CFEs in Latin America are not replicable on a large scale. Our proposal is feasible and shows great potential, considering not only the use of resources but also the incorporation of factors involved in the genesis of a health problem to facilitate efficient decision-making.

AB  - Chronic liver disease (CLD) stands as a formidable health challenge, casting a long shadow across global healthcare landscapes. Its progression, often silent until advanced stages, makes it a particularly perilous condition, leading to significant morbidity and mortality if left unchecked. The dangers of liver disease cannot be overstated, with its ability to disrupt the liver's essential functions, from filtering toxins to aiding in digestion. Awareness about liver health is crucial, as early detection can dramatically alter the course of the disease, offering pathways to management or even reversal of damage in some cases. In the United States, liver disease has become a significant health crisis, with alarming statistics highlighting the need for urgent attention. Liver disease accounts for thousands of deaths annually, with recent figures indicating a steady rise in liver-related mortality. Factors contributing to this trend include the prevalence of hepatitis C, alcohol-related liver disease, and the emerging epidemic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), driven by rising obesity rates. These statistics serve not just as numbers but as a clarion call for enhanced prevention, early detection, and treatment efforts to stem the tide of CLD. Advancements in machine learning (ML) models offer a beacon of hope in the fight against liver disease. Researchers can now predict the onset and progression of liver disease more accurately than ever by employing models such as RandomForest, LightGBM, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Ensemble Learning Stacking, and ExtraTrees. These models, through their predictive capabilities, have the potential to revolutionize how we approach CLD, making it possible to identify at-risk individuals earlier and tailor interventions more effectively. The impact of these technological innovations could be profound, significantly reducing mortality rates by enabling the medical community to act swiftly and decisively in preventing and managing liver disease.

AB  - Polyfolicular ovarian syndrome or (PCOS) is one of a medical disorder that affects female pregnancy. This paper proposes a method of prediction of PCOS using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These are disorders that occur in female ovaries which will lead to infertility. A lot of factors that will be considered to predict whether a woman comes under PCOS or not are obesity, hair distribution, menstrual abnormalities (BMI), Follicle-stimulating hormone, Luteinizing hormone), e.t.c. The data set considered for analysis consists of 44 features for detecting PCOS but the problem here with the data is its imbalance. A more significant number of PCOS fewer patient samples are contributed to the dataset to overcome a proposed method is used in imbalanced learning techniques such as oversampling minority data, under-sampling majority data, SMOTE, and ensemble. The features are extracted from the data set and classified with an ANN-based algorithm. The scaling technique is done on the data to have the same range and fed into the network for training and testing. Data visualization is done to find the correlation between the data.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease, a long-term kidney disorder that leads to high cardiovascular disease, is mainly caused by diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and urinary infections. Kidneys are vital organs in the human body, so early detection of chronic kidney disorders is very necessary in order to startthe clinical process. This research mainly aims at categorizing whether the patient diagnosed has chronic kidney disease from the 24 attributes and comparing them with the values in the dataset to start the medical treatments at the earliest. This study has developed and implemented multiple models and the binary classification neural network got the most accurate result with an accuracy of 99.23%. We also noticed a very low loss value, which is 0.023%, due to the ReLu activation layer function in the hidden layer and the hard sigmoid and sigmoid functions in the output layers. Along with this, the other models deployed include Decision Tree, Extra Tree and Support Vector Machine models in order to get the most accurate model for predicting chronic kidney disease from the provided dataset. The accuracy records of the employed models are Extra Tree (98.75%), Decision Tree (95.0%), and Support Vector Machine (93.75%).

AB  - Nowadays, due to busy schedules, many people are unaware of what they are eating and their physical condition. This scenario will lead to various health issues such as obesity, diabetes, blood pressure, etc. Hence, it has become very essential for people to have a good balanced nutritional healthy diet to deal with those issues. Therefore, it is important to determine what factors may be conducive to healthy eating behaviors among people with different Body Mass Index (BMI). A predictive analysis approach in data mining can be used to identify the food consumption pattern in people's eating habits and how it is related to their body type. This study aims to classify body types based on eating habits and physical conditions using a decision tree induction algorithm. Several phases have been conducted in this study such as data understanding, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation. In the experimental phase, the datasets that are known as full dataset and reduced dataset have been used to identify which dataset will produce high accuracy. As a result, it is shown that a full dataset produces higher accuracy compared to a reduced dataset. Perhaps there is room for improvement in the reduced dataset by applying other attribute selection methods to produce better accuracy of the classifier. This study brings a high significance for effectiveness and efficiency in eating habits and physical condition analysis based on body type, and it can also be explored for other classification methods for future work enhancement.

AB  - This paper presents an integrated and scalable precision health service for health promotion and chronic disease prevention. Continuous real-time monitoring of lifestyle and environmental factors is implemented by integrating wearable devices, open environmental data, indoor air quality sensing devices, a location-based smartphone app, and an AI-assisted telecare platform. The AI-assisted telecare platform provided comprehensive insight into patients’ clinical, lifestyle, and environmental data, and generated reliable predictions of future acute exacerbation events. All data from 1,667 patients were collected prospectively during a 24-month follow-up period, resulting in the detection of 386 abnormal episodes. Machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms were used to train modular chronic disease models. The modular chronic disease prediction models that have passed external validation include obesity, panic disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with an average accuracy of 88.46%, a sensitivity of 75.6%, a specificity of 93.0%, and an F1 score of 79.8%. Compared with previous studies, we establish an effective way to collect lifestyle, life trajectory, and symptom records, as well as environmental factors, and improve the performance of the prediction model by adding objective comprehensive data and feature selection. Our results also demonstrate that lifestyle and environmental factors are highly correlated with patient health and have the potential to predict future abnormal events better than using only questionnaire data. Furthermore, we have constructed a cost-effective model that needs only a few features to support the prediction task, which is helpful for deploying real-world modular prediction models.

AB  - Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater. Obesity is a complex medical condition characterized by excess body fat that increases the risk of developing co-morbidities like cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Excess weight is a global concern with an ever-growing prevalence. This research study aims to develop effective and practical post-surgical guidelines based on clinical data to determine potential predictors of surgical success. With this information, clinicians and patients can work together to minimize long-term weight regain post-surgery. To fulfill this goal, we applied various machine learning (ML) algorithms to model our dataset and provide a list of critical features to target to have more successful long-term weight-loss outcomes. Fortunately, our ML models achieved outstanding Mean Absolute Errors (0.10 - 0.22).

AB  - Studies show poor lifestyle choices and unhealthy eating patterns cause issues like obesity and other ongoing illnesses that raise the risk of heart attacks, such as hypertension, abnormal blood sugar levels, and diabetes. To improve this situation a lot of health apps have been built which use modern dietary monitoring systems that automatically evaluate dietary intake using machine learning and deep learning techniques rather. For these reasons indepth investigations on food detection, classification, and analysis have been conducted. Some of the top methods for automatic food recognition created have been discussed in this paper. We also propose an idea for detection of Indian food items using image classification. According to our findings of the papers we reviewed, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been extensively been used in food detection as it has been giving better results compared to other models. We also observed that Vision transformers perform better in situations where the dataset is large and a hybrid model would give better accuracy. A review of potential applications for food image analysis, shortfalls in the area, and open issues concludes the paper.

AB  - Obesity and sedentary lifestyles have become significant health concerns globally. To solve these issues, this system presents a Diet Plan and Home Exercise Recommendation System (SYP) that utilizes users' smartwatch data and pathological information to generate personalized diet plans and exercise recommendations. The proposed SYP system leverages the capabilities of modern smartwatches, which are equipped with various sensors to collect comprehensive health data. Additionally, it incorporates users' pathological data obtained through medical tests. By integrating these diverse datasets, the system can provide tailored recommendations based on an individual's specific health profile. The SYP system operates in two main phases: data collection and recommendation generation. During the data collection phase, the system collects and analyzes data from users' smartwatches and pathological records, such as heart rate, sleep patterns, blood pressure, glucose levels, and body mass index. The collected data is then processed to extract relevant features and construct a comprehensive health profile for each user. In the recommendation generation phase, the SYP system employs machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's health profile and generate personalized diet plans and home exercise recommendations. The generated recommendations are designed to be practical, feasible, and aligned with the user's health objectives.

AB  - Overweight and obesity are pointed out as a serious threat to the health of people. According to a 2016 report by WHO, 1.9 billion people worldwide are overweight and 650 million are obese. Because the obesity causes various cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and musculoskeletal disorders, it is important to assess the risk of obesity in order to prepare its prevention policies. To deal with this problem, logistic regressions and decision trees are widely applied and then employed as primary classifiers. This paper intends to present a combined learning approach to classifying the risk of overweight and obesity. In our framework, logistic regression models are cascaded onto decision tree classifiers. This feature would be applicable to improving the predictive capability of primary classifiers. Experimental results, using an open dataset provided by Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, show that the proposed scheme improves the classification accuracy by 5% to 27%.

AB  - Stunting poses a significant health challenge in Indonesia, with a prevalence rate reaching 21.6% in 2022, exceeding the WHO's tolerance limit for stunting. This study aims to identify stunting in toddlers using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Naive Bayes (NB) algorithms. The KNN method is chosen for its effectiveness in utilizing the similarity between the attributes of new data and the training dataset, while Naive Bayes is selected for its probabilistic approach, addressing attributes related to stunting in toddlers. The dataset, obtained from the Bojongsoang Community Health Centre, underwent preprocessing to address initial imbalances such as converting the age format to month and removing an irrelevant column like address details. The attributes used in this study include age-in-months, height, weight, Z-Score Weight-for-Age, Z-Score Height-for-Age, and Z-Score Weight-for-Height. This research uses an SMOTE algorithm for handling imbalance data. In the SMOTE algorithm, imbalanced data can be managed by using undersampling and oversampling techniques. The research reveals a significant improvement in both KNN and NB models after applying the oversampling technique. Particularly, the KNN model demonstrates superior performance, increasing the F1-Score from 67.20% to 95.62%, with an accuracy of 95.67%. The Naive Bayes model also experiences enhancement, raising the F1-Score from 71.22% to 95.62%, with an accuracy of 94%. This study contributes to effective stunting classification methods. Leveraging direct measurements of height and weight, the research aids in stunting identification and proposes methods, including oversampling, to enhance classification accuracy KNN and Naive Bayes.

AB  - Obesity is a major health problem, increasing the risk of various major chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and stroke. While the role of obesity identified by cross-sectional BMI recordings has been heavily studied, the role of BMI trajectories is much less explored. In this study, we use a machine learning approach to subtype individuals' risk of developing 18 major chronic diseases by using their BMI trajectories extracted from a large and geographically diverse EHR dataset capturing the health status of around two million individuals for a period of six years. We define nine new interpretable and evidence-based variables based on the BMI trajectories to cluster the patients into subgroups using the k-means clustering method. We thoroughly review each cluster's characteristics in terms of demographic, socioeconomic, and physiological measurement variables to specify the distinct properties of the patients in the clusters. In our experiments, the direct relationship of obesity with diabetes, hypertension, Alzheimer's, and dementia has been re-established and distinct clusters with specific characteristics for several of the chronic diseases have been found to be conforming or complementary to the existing body of knowledge.

AB  - Chronic diabetes Mellitus (DM) leads to severe consequences such as nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Various learning algorithms are employed to forecast and categorize eight issues, encompassing metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia. Machine learning is revolutionizing various domains by enabling algorithms to extract models from data. The main objective of this proposed study is to utilize binary classifiers to predict and categorize eight problems associated with DM. For this study we have used the dataset obtained from the Jeevandeep Hospital and Research Centre (JHRC) in Baripada, Mayurbhanj, Odisha, India. It includes 1296 records and has nine input variables and eight output categories that indicate different issues. Multiple models were constructed to address problems like Nephropathy, neuropathy, dyslipidemia, diabetic foot, metabolic syndrome, retinopathy, hypertension, and obesity. Different preprocessing operations on missing data, unbalanced data, and feature selection are employed. Binary classifiers were developed for each type of complication, with the number of records varied for each. Subsequently, an evaluation was conducted. The models achieved a maximum of 95.7% accuracy and 97.9% F1 score. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using selected features to build accurate classifiers for predicting diabetes complications.

AB  - There is a significant amount of interest in machine learning, and scientists generally examine its application in every possible setting. Breast cancer is one of the diseases that have the highest mortality rate among women. As a result of a delay in the detection of malignant tissues, it is also known as the second biggest cause of mortality in the world. Postmenopausal symptoms, obesity, genes passed down from families, hormonal imbalance, and genetic abnormalities that are not expressed are the most prevalent risk factors for breast cancer. Even though breast cancer is being discovered at a later stage in many underdeveloped nations, death rates remain excessively high. Early detection is essential if we are to bring the mortality toll down and save more lives. Histopathological pictures are the types of data that are taken into consideration by the suggested method. In this article, we will concentrate mostly on distinguishing between benign and malignant forms of cancer. In this investigation, the diagnosis of breast cancer was accomplished by the application of linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The model is evaluated with the assistance of efficiency indicators such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as the F1-score.

AB  - The burgeoning prevalence of obesity worldwide has triggered interest in the health and quality of life repercussions it carries. Weight loss shows promising results when it comes to tackling the consequences. Dietitians and nutritionists recommend logging daily intake of food items. Manual entry is tedious; hence, we propose a digital system that allows one to recognize a food item and estimate its calories by clicking a single image from the top. The proposed system identifies food items using an incrementally trained AdaBoost classifier, which takes as input a 94 dimension feature vector. The image is further processed using morphological operations, edge detection algorithms and contour detection techniques to segment the food item and compute its volume for calorie estimation. The classification algorithm gives a 90% accuracy while the estimated calories have a relative error of 18%.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome is a Females health problem that influence 1 in 20 females of gestation phase (18-44). PCOS occurs in the last two decades in India. Females with Polycystic ovary syndrome have hormonal inequality and anabolism issue which will influence their complete strength and presence. "PCOS is the cause of more than 75% of ovulatory infertility, which is infertility caused in a woman." Medicinal circumstances such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) do not have in effect techniques for diagnosis and proper management. Unfortunately, PCOS is that the commonest endocrinal syndrome which has been, to date, ignored by many. Treating to PCOS regular exercise is very beneficial. Exercise helps lower cholesterol levels and those of other hormones, such as testosterone and also is helpful to fight the obesity, decreases insulin resistance, by burning calories and building muscle mass. According to present investigation, PCOS rises the risk of endometrial cancer in females. This paper suggested a most unique and effective method as automatic acknowledgment of cyst in sonography picture. This paper proposed YOLO algorithm (You Only Look Once) which recognize the real-time of PCOS images or Non PCOS images. In this proposed method, a single convolutional neural network (CNN) was deployed to spontaneously identify the PCOS or Non-PCOS image from the ultrasound images.

AB  - The methods used to prescribe exercises today are hampered by a lack of understanding and by inefficient methods. Yoga and meditation, two traditional Indian health techniques, have been demonstrated to improve immunity, strength, and mental health by lowering stress and depression, promoting restful sleep, and boosting the immune system. The immune system is strengthened by exercise, which also reduces the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. It is advised by the WHO, and communication technologies allow people to share on health websites and in online communities. The contradictory advice offered by various sources, however, might be inaccurate and needs to be screened for accuracy. There are medical disclaimers involved. Encouragement of exercise can lower healthcare costs brought on by sedentary behaviour. According to research, stair climbing, running, and jumping can boost health and fend off viral illnesses. Exercises that enhance the immune system are part of the recommended programme. Personal recommendations are generated by a convolution neural network based on physical activity and immunological function. Both healthy and unwell people receive automatic advice.

AB  - Although the healthcare sector is generally “information-rich,” sadly, not all data are mined, which is necessary for finding hidden patterns and making wise decisions. In medical research and especially in the prediction of heart disease, sophisticated data mining methods are used. These methods are also used to predict the data that is contained in databases. In this article, prediction systems for heart failure have been examined using a larger number of input attributes. The method analyses 13 variables, including medical words like sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol, to forecast the risk that a patient will develop heart disease. 13 attributes have been used for prediction. In this study, smoking and obesity were introduced as two more characteristics. In the existing systems, we have used Naïve Bayes and neural networking systems, which have less accuracy compared to the proposed system algorithms. On a database of heart diseases, the proposed data mining classification algorithms J48 Decision Trees, Bagging, and Adaboost are examined. Based on the accuracy, these techniques' performances are contrasted. According to our findings, the Adaboost, J48 decision tree, and bagging accuracy are 92.1 percent, 91.62 percent, and 90.52 percent, respectively. Our investigation reveals that Adaboost, out of these three classification methods, accurately predicts heart failure.

AB  - With the improvement of living standards and changes in work habits caused by industrialization, the prevalence of diseases related to lifestyle is rising. In this context, the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases (LRDs) is extremely important. The majority of existing research exclusively concentrates on the prognosis of a particular LRD sickness, making it impossible for them to intelligently identify the important characteristics of the disease. Therefore, this study aims to propose a lifestyle-related disease prediction framework including three key components, called missing value module, feature selection module, and disease prediction module. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated by using real medical data gathered during a hospital in Nanjing, China. The experiment shows that the proposed framework can automatically generate prediction ensemble models for specific LRDs diseases, and achieve good accurate performance.

AB  - Diabetes, especially T2DM, continues to be a significant health problem. One of the major concerns associated with diabetes is the development of its complications. Diabetic nephropathy, one of the chronic complication of diabetes, adversely affects the kidneys, leading to kidney damage. Diagnosing diabetic nephropathy involves considering various criteria, one of which is the presence of a pathologically significant quantity of albumin in urine, known as albuminuria. Thus, early prediction of albuminuria in diabetic patients holds the potential for timely preventive measures. This study aimed to develop a supervised learning model to predict the risk of developing albuminuria in T2DM patients. The selected supervised learning algorithms included Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Our private dataset, comprising 184 entries of diabetes complications risk factors, was used to train the algorithms. It consisted of 10 attributes as features and 1 attribute as the target (albuminuria). Upon conducting the experiments, the MLP demonstrated superior performance compared to the other algorithms. It achieved accuracy and f1-score values as high as 0.74 and 0.75, respectively, making it suitable for screening purposes in predicting albuminuria in T2DM. Nonetheless, further studies are warranted to enhance the model's performance.

AB  - Lung cancer is the most dangerous disease. Lung cancer has a huge impact on mortality rates worldwide. It is the top causes of cancer-related fatalities worldwide. Lung cancer development, prevention, and lifestyle are all linked. Smoking, occupational hazards, air pollution, an unbalanced diet, and other lifestyle factors are major contributors to lung cancer. The use of lifestyle indicators can aid in the early detection of lung cancer. In this study, a model is constructed based on lifestyle data to predict lung cancer, and the model is then extended to predict the level of lung cancer as low, medium, or high. The basic lifestyle parameters are examined first, and if the model forecasts the potential of lung cancer, the second component of the model analyses each parameter further and predicts the level of cancer. The first portion of the model employs logistic regression with k-fold validation and Support Vector Machine with k-fold cross-validation to predict lung cancer. The Support Vector Machine predicts with 90% accuracy, while the logistic regression model predicts with 92% accuracy. The second component of the model used SVM and Random Forest models to estimate the amount of malignancy, with Random Forest providing 96% accuracy and SVM providing 98.42% accuracy for cancer prediction. The goal of this study is to predict lung cancer early using data from lifestyle parameters.

AB  - Hormonal imbalances in women of reproductive age, such as PCOS, are a major contributor to female infertility. Acne, menstrual irregularities, excess hair growth, and obesity are all indications of polycystic ovary syndrome. In order to control the symptoms and lessen the health risks connected with PCOS, a quick diagnosis is crucial. Rotterdam criteria are used to make the diagnosis regardless; these include a high androgen hormone level, inability to ovulate, and an ultrasound finding of polycystic ovaries (PCOM). One of the difficult PCOS diagnostic criteria is the diagnosis of PCOM using ovarian ultrasonography that is now performed manually by doctors and radiologists through the counting of follicles and the determination of their thickness in the ovaries. Along with attending to the patient's symptoms, these doctors also need to look for biochemical and clinical indicators of PCOS in order to make a diagnosis. In addition, there is no standard diagnostic procedure or test that doctors use. In order to detect polycistic ovaries from ultrasound pictures of ovarian tissue, we created a Hybrid Deep Learning Model consisting of an Ensemble Inception Model and a LightGBM. The suggested model achieved an accuracy of 98.73% on test pictures, whereas the InceptionV3 achieved an accuracy of 95.34%. This difference was proved by comparing the two models on a number of quantitative effectiveness assessment metrics.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing health disparities, and its impact has fallen disproportionately on disadvantaged and vulnerable communities. Racial and ethnic minorities such as Black Americans who are at a particular disadvantage are more likely to be the potential target of COVID-19 infection and are dying at alarmingly high rates. Despite a promising solution of the COVID-19 vaccination offers hope, equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines remains a challenge in the US, which has compounded the existing disparities in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among racial and ethnic minority groups. The deep and pervasive history of medical racism in the US has led to the vaccine hesitancy in racial and ethnic minorities, and thereby caused the disparities. Although some studies examine determinants of health disparities (e.g., social health determinants), there is a shortage of studies examining the social, structural and constructural health determinants, either alone or in tandem with other determinants. Little research paid attention to leveraging geographic information to trace the social, structural and constructural health determinants, which can provide a lower level of granularity. In this paper, we propose DeepHealth, a geospatial and ML-based (machine learning based) approach to identify diverse determinants (including the social, structural, and constructural determinants) of health disparities in COVID-19 pandemic, which provides a lower level of granularity. We provide a thorough analysis of health disparities based on multiple COVID-19 datasets and examine the social, structural, and constructural health determinants to assist in ascertaining why disparities (in racial and ethnic minorities who are particularly disadvantaged) occur in incidence and mortality rates due to COVID-19 pandemic. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach. This research provides new strategies for health disparity identification and determinant tracking with a goal of mitigating health disparities and improving pandemic health care. The research suggests that policymakers should give attention to initiatives that will protect the health of populations (i.e., an upstream approach to reducing health disparities) rather than solely focusing only on providing health and social services.

AB  - Obesity is a common, serious, and costly chronic disease in the United States, a risk factor for several major cancers, linked to higher rates of illness and death. It is thus a critical issue that needs attention from health care professionals and the public alike. We use a novel approach to target nonstandard variations to better understand the variables associated with weight loss. We introduce a new methodology using the Choquet Integral with fuzzy measure, an approach that accounts for interactions between measured features. The Choquet Integral has limited sourced applications to the biomedical field despite widespread use in theoretical mathematics and economics. Our technique applies it to health data to show a robust method to target and optimize weight loss parameters. We identify data versus noise, optimally choose a reduced version of the powerset for computability purposes, and identify the sub-additive cooperative learning bound of the Choquet Integral. We show that the proposed technique targets heretofore unknown variations in predictive weight loss studies with broad potential applications.

AB  - Dietary patterns can be the primary reason for many chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. State-of-the-art wearable sensor technologies can play a critical role in assisting patients in managing their eating habits by providing meaningful statistics on critical parameters such as the onset, duration, and frequency of eating. For an accurate yet fast food intake recognition, this work presents a novel Machine Learning (ML) based framework that shows promising results by leveraging optimized support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The SVM classifiers are trained on three comprehensive datasets: OREBA, FIC, and CLEMSON. The developed framework outperforms existing algorithms by achieving F1-scores of $\bf 92\%$, $\bf 94\%$, $\bf 95\%$, and $\bf 85\%$ on OREBA-SHA, OREBA-DIS, FIC, and CLEMSON datasets, respectively. In order to assess the generalization aspects, the proposed SVM framework is also trained on one of the three databases while being tested on the others and achieves acceptable F1-scores in all cases. The proposed algorithm is well suited for real-time applications since inference is made using a few support vector parameters compared to thousands in peer deep neural networks models.

AB  - The prevalence of cardiovascular disease has been steadily rising, driven by factors such as sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy dietary habits, tobacco use, obesity, and an aging population. According to the According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the (GBD) study, cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death. In addition to comparing the performance of the five machine learning algorithms and two different datasets, this study also aims to investigate the impact of different algorithmic approaches on heart disease prediction. Logistic regression is a widely-used algorithm for binary classification, utilizing a linear function to model the relationship between input features and the target variable. K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm relies on similarity measures to classify instances based on their proximity to known instances. Random forest, a powerful ensemble method, combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. Decision tree algorithms employ a hierarchical structure of nodes and branches to make sequential decisions. Support vector machines (SVM) aim to find an optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space To conduct the evaluation, a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository containing relevant features and corresponding heart disease labels was utilized. Prior to training and testing the algorithms, the dataset underwent exploratory data analysis to understand its characteristics. Preprocessing steps were employed to handle missing values and scale the features appropriately. To ensure unbiased evaluation, the collection of data is subsequently split between train and testing collections with a 70 to 30 ratio. Several factors, such as the F1 score, an area underneath a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), recall, accuracy, and exactness were used to assess the algorithms' performance. Depending on the experimental findings, the random forest method outperformed logistic regression, KNN, decision trees, and SVM in terms of all assessment measures. Its greater F1 score, AUC, recall, accuracy, and precision all point to its improved capacity to distinguish between cases and non-cases of heart disease.

AB  - An advanced convolutional neural network architecture for forecasting blood glucose is proposed in this paper. Four different measures are introduced in this essay, including Glucose, Meal, Insulin, and Time of the day, which are denoted as G, M, I, and T for short. Past 2-hour historical data of individuals are exploited to predict the future glucose level in 30 minutes with high accuracy. To verify the effectiveness of the blood glucose prediction model, three major methods have been displayed and compared. To be more specific, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was the better model for forecasting blood glucose, compared with Neural Network Predictive Glucose (NNPG) and Support Vector Regression (SVM). The metrics of evaluation are Root-Mean-Square deviation (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD). The average of the best RMSE is 7.75, which is largely better than those of the other two models. This result shows the superior performance of RNN in accurate glucose prediction.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread illness and death around the world. Massive and complex Electronic health records (EHRs) hold important information to help COVID-19 patients get an accurate diagnosis and prognosis. In this research, we suggested a novel ensemble of decision trees method for analyzing and classifying COVID-19 EHR data. The proposed approach uses misclassified samples at each iteration to improve accuracy. Pneumonia, hypertension, diabetes, male gender, and higher age groups were the most important features in classifying patients into “COVID-negative” “COVID-positive and survived” and “COVID-positive and died” To evaluate the efficacy of our suggested ensemble model, we contrasted it with well-established models. Compared to the baseline models, the experimental findings demonstrated that the ensemble model greatly outperformed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This research shows the significance of EHRs in COVID-19 patient classification and suggests an innovative method to improve classification accuracy. The most prominent traits in high-risk patients can serve as early warning indicators, allowing for quick intervention and better outcomes overall. The suggested ensemble model has practical applications in the early detection and efficient patient treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Human body photographs contain encodings for gender, weight, and other biometric data in addition to pupil color. When considering all of this information, body weight is a reliable indicator of health problems. Body measurements including height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) are important because they can be used for a variety of purposes like surveillance, re-identification, picture retrieval systems, and healthcare. The majority of earlier research on automated height, weight, and BMI measurement has made use of 3D whole body videos and 2D and full body 2D pictures. A person's weight in proportion to their height is gauged by their BMI. It serves more as a gauge for calculating total body fat. Because it is frequently used to evaluate health issues, BMI is important. Our chances of living a longer, healthier life are said to be increased by having a healthy body mass index (BMI).The BMI range may be identified and classified using picture analysis, which can help individuals forecast credibility, manage their BMI, and lead healthier lives. There hasn't been much discussion on face estimation. Being overweight has been linked to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Weight is also an important health indicator. Using the methods Linear Regression, Ridge Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Kernel Ridge Regression, CNN algorithm, and Resnet-50 Architecture, we test the feasibility of estimating height, weight, and BMI from single-shot face photos. In order to estimate height, weight, and BMI, we will evaluate these regression models and select the one with the highest test score.

AB  - The amount of data being gathered in the modern world is enormous. This information was gathered from a variety of places, including the manufacturing, healthcare, and social media industries. The healthcare sector provides a lot of information. Particularly heart disease, wherein a lack of blood flow results in the tissue in the heart muscle dying and causes chest pain and heart attacks. When heart disease is diagnosed early on, it is possible to successfully cure the condition. Heart attacks are on the rise among people today for a variety of reasons, including high work demands, a lack of physical activity, irregular eating patterns, obesity, and consuming foods high in fat. India carries a high burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with the anticipated figure of deaths related to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) on a yearly basis is predicted to experience a sharp rise from 2.26 million in 1990 to 4.77 million in the year 2020[1]. This study’s main objective is to use machine learning models to detect heart attacks. The evaluation of the model in just not limited to the accuracy metrics, though accuracy of the model plays an important role, recall (TPR) has been also given importance. In healthcare applications like heart disease prediction, high recall is important to correctly identify most cases of the disease. However, precision might be lower to avoid misclassifying patients who do not have the condition upon further diagnosis. Balancing both is crucial for an effective and accurate prediction model. Finding coronary artery disease in its earliest stages could mean the difference between thousands of people’s lives and deaths.

AB  - The most common and widespread disease among today's population is liver disease, which is caused by excessive alcohol consumption, polluted gas produced by various chemical factories, drugs, spoiled or tainted food, and obesity. Liver is the most important body organ as it performs the detoxification process. As a result, early disease detection plays a crucial role in the disease diagnosis and recovery process. Early prediction of liver disease has been made possible with the introduction of machine learning technology. This technology provides significant benefits to the healthcare sector by developing new ways to deploy early disease prediction system even in a remote location. SVM, KNN, K-Mean clustering, neural networks, decision trees, and other machine learning techniques are used to implement liver disease diagnosis in order to provide varying levels of accuracy, precision and sensitivity. Unsupervised learning, supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning can also be used. This research study intends to compare all the machine learning algorithms to investigate and predict the liver disease and the resultant performance is evaluated based on sensitivity, relevance, accuracy, and precision.

AB  - Liver disease can be genetic. The liver can be damaged by alcohol use, obesity and hepatitis viruses. Chronic liver disease has many causes like Liver cancer, Cirrhosis and life threatening conditions. So prevention treatment can help to heal the damage and prevent liver failure. Hence, the time required to introduce the machine learning techniques which minimize the error and give more accuracy. Aim of this research paper is categories into two phases. In the first phase six classification algorithms (LR, KNN, SVM, NB, DT, and RF) are compared with ML Classification evaluation metrics. As a consequence, Logistic Regression obtained a higher accuracy of 71.6% in liver disease prediction than the other classification algorithms. In Phase 2, we selected a sample from a classification method with lower accuracy, such as Random Forest, Decision Tree algorithms and we adjusted the hyper parameters. RF accuracy is improved after Hyper Parameter Optimization by +4%, whereas Decision Tree algorithm accuracy is improved by +12%.

AB  - The field of imbalanced self-supervised learning, especially in the context of tabular data, has not been extensively studied. Existing research has predominantly focused on image datasets. This paper aims to fill this gap by examining the specific challenges posed by data imbalance in self-supervised learning in the domain of tabular data, with a primary focus on autoencoders. Autoencoders are widely employed for learning and constructing a new representation of a dataset, particularly for dimensionality reduction. They are also often used for generative model learning, as seen in variational autoencoders. When dealing with mixed tabular data, qualitative variables are often encoded using a one-hot encoder with a standard loss function (MSE or Cross Entropy). In this paper, we analyze the drawbacks of this approach, especially when categorical variables are imbalanced. We propose a novel metric to balance learning: a Multi-Supervised Balanced MSE. This approach reduces the reconstruction error by balancing the influence of variables. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that this new metric, compared to the standard MSE: i) outperforms when the dataset is imbalanced, especially when the learning process is insufficient, and ii) provides similar results in the opposite case.

AB  - Food Intake Detection from wearable sensor signals is essential in applications like dietary monitoring. Traditional annotation methods for sensor datasets are notably labor-intensive and time-consuming. Addressing this, our paper presents a novel methodology that employs a denoising convolutional autoencoder trained on an extensive unannotated dataset to extract key discriminative features from the sensor data. Subsequently, a small, selectively annotated subset of this dataset is utilized to train a LightGBM classifier. The classifier leverages the features extracted by the autoencoder to distinguish between eating and non-eating events effectively. Our research utilizes the AIM-2 sensor system, equipped with a 3D accelerometer and an optical sensor mounted on eyeglasses to monitor muscle movement and head motion. Data was collected from 17 participants, each wearing eyeglasses for varying durations. For validating the LightGBM classifier, a cross-validation method was used where the data from each participant was used once as a test set, and the data from eight randomly selected others formed the training set. Repeated for each participant, this approach ensured individual data contribution to the validation. The final performance metrics, calculated as an average across all participants, demonstrated robust results with an F1 score of 83.71%, a specificity of 88.43%, and a sensitivity of 86.26%. These performance metrics underscore the efficacy of our approach, which significantly reduces the need for extensive data annotation.

AB  - Across the world, people are growing more dietary sensitive today. An unbalanced diet can result in a variety of issues, including weight gain, obesity, diabetes, etc. As a result, many techniques were created to analyse images of food and determine factors like calories as well as nutrition content. One of the most essential needs of every living thing on earth is food. Humans demand that the food they eat be of standard quality, freshness, and purity. Food quality is taken care of by the standards set and automation implemented in the food processing business. The idea of using food as medicine has gained traction in recent years, in part due to doctors' and practitioners' increased understanding of the importance of including food in the treatment of chronic illnesses alongside drugs. Food measurement is crucial for a good healthy diet. One of the difficult tasks in maintaining diet is calorie and nutritional content measurement in daily eating. In today's technology age, the smartphone exacerbates the problem with nutritional intake. The meal image recognition algorithm for calculating the nutritional and calorie values has been established in this survey analysis. The system classifies the meal once the user takes a picture of it to determine the type of food, the portion size, and the expected number of calories. This approach uses food area, size, and volume to accurately compute calories and nutrition. Due to the difficulty in achieving accuracy to classify food images, many images have been trained to attain high accuracy.

AB  - The main goal of this study is to use Data Mining Method and Artificial Neural Network to develop a system that can automatically and rapidly predict the risk of coronary heart disease (ANN). The IRT Perundurai Medical College and Hospital's master health checkup data on occupational drivers were used to test this idea (PMCH). Analysis for risk identification is performed in the first stage of the hybrid approach suggested in this study, and level prediction is performed in the second. The sensitivity, specificity, precision, receiver operating curve, area under curve, 10-fold cross validation technique, and the F-measure are used for this investigation. The initial step of the study involves thinking about the most common and changeable dangers. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI) are three biophysical variables, whereas fasting blood sugar, postprandial blood sugar, and triglyceride levels are three blood chemical factors (TG). All of these characteristics have a predetermined margin value that is based on WHO guidelines. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and the C4.5 algorithm in Decision Tree are the three approaches used to categorize these variables and forecast the risk (DT). The C4.5 algorithm fared best in forecasting CHD risk when the three approaches were compared using the performance metrics, as discovered by the investigation. The decision tree C4.5 method outperformed the other two classifiers with an improved 99.5% accuracy and 99.67% sensitivity. The increased percentage demonstrates that the Decision tree method delivered consistent results that were better to those produced by the Naive Bayes and SVM models.

AB  - The rapid growth of chronic diseases and medical conditions (e.g. obesity, depression, diabetes, respiratory and musculoskeletal diseases) in many OECD countries has become one of the most significant wellbeing problems, which also poses pressure to the sustainability of healthcare and economies. Thus, it is important to promote early diagnosis, intervention, and healthier lifestyles. One partial solution to the problem is extending long-term health monitoring from hospitals to natural living environments. It has been shown in laboratory settings and practical trials that sensor data, such as camera images, radio samples, acoustics signals, infrared etc., can be used for accurately modelling activity patterns that are related to different medical conditions. However, due to the rising concern related to private data leaks and, consequently, stricter personal data regulations, the growth of pervasive residential sensing for healthcare applications has been slow. To mitigate public concern and meet the regulatory requirements, our national multi-partner SPHERE-DNA project aims to combine pervasive sensing tech-nology with secured and privacy-preserving distributed privacy frameworks for healthcare applications. The project leverages local differential privacy federated learning (LDP-FL) to achieve resilience against active and passive attacks, as well as edge computing to avoid transmitting sensitive data over networks. Combinations of sensor data modalities and security architectures are explored by a machine learning architecture for finding the most viable technology combinations, relying on metrics that allow balancing between computational cost and accuracy for a desired level of privacy. We also consider realistic edge computing platforms and develop hardware acceleration and approximate computing techniques to facilitate the adoption of LDP-FL and privacy preserving signal processing to lightweight edge processors. A proof-of-concept (PoC) multimodal sensing system will be developed and a novel multimodal dataset will be collected during the project to verify the concept.

AB  - Early detection of stunting status in toddlers must be done by recognizing important factors that affect the stunting status of toddlers to be precise and accurate. The stunting status of this study was normal and stunting. A two-stage filter method has been used to determine the subset of dataset features capable of producing a stunting status detection system with the expected accuracy. The first stage was carried out to discover the important features related to the stunting status of toddlers. These important features are obtained by measuring the level of relevance of dataset features to stunting status (Target Class). The level of relevance was measured using univariate and mutual information filter methods. The univariate types used were ANOVA and Chi-Square, while the mutual information types used were Information Gain and minimal-Redundancy-Maximal-Relevance (mRMR). The second stage aims to determine the subset of dataset features that differentiate the target class. The feature subset is formed using a forward selection technique starting from features with a high level of relevance to the target class. The addition of feature subset members is based on the ranking order obtained. Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Support Vector Machine are applied to determine classification accuracy using a combination of features provided by the filter method. The experimental results show that the best accuracy is produced by SVM without using a filter. Prediction of stunting status will decrease its performance if one or more features are removed. The results of this study can contribute to the preprocessing step to determine the best features in the early detection of stunting status in toddlers.

AB  - Due to the pandemic, an increase in obesity could be observed due to the sedentary life that university students had. Overall, this is a worrying trend, particularly the rising rates of obesity in young people and their lack of physical activity. The paper aims to evaluate university students' physical activity through a computer vision prototype using Azure Kinect. This has made it possible to establish a baseline for the physical activity of young university students. For this, 50 university students from a university in Arequipa-Peru were evaluated. Two tests were carried out, one of jump height and another of bicep curl. As a result, the percentiles of the tests performed were obtained, and the prototype was developed that evaluated efficiently the correlation coefficients vertical jump test for the hip angle-Distance, it was 0.50 moderately. The Knee Angle-Distance was 0.38, considered weak; in terms of the correlation coefficients bicep curl test for the Maximum angle of flexion- Repetitions was -0.16, very weak, and for the Maximum angle of extension-Repetitions, it was -0.06, considered very weak. In conclusion, it was possible to indicate that using the computer vision prototype using Azure Kinect allows for obtaining results that specialists can use to determine the physical condition more efficiently for university students.

AB  - Now-a-days, children are more indulged in indoor activities instead of outdoor games. This plays a very negative role on their minds along with physical laziness and obesity. The proposed system that solves this issue uses virtual reality gaming interface and activity recognition system for the users to play outdoor games in their rooms. People can wear the headsets along with wearables and can enjoy 3D games while exercising. The system uses sensors (MPU6050) connected with nRF24L01 modules and Arduino responsible for sending the sensor data to the game. Moreover, the data by sensor is processed using a machine learning model, which predicts the game played by the user. The proposed system aims at recognizing six basic games in the IMSporting behaviors dataset, which utilizes triaxial accelerometers connected to the subject’s knee, wrist, and below neck areas to capture human activities i.e., badminton, basketball, table tennis, skipping, cycling and football. WISDM dataset is used to recognize activities such as jogging and walking. The system has achieved an accuracy of 92% by using median filter as a pre-processing technique, Fourier transform features extraction and artificial neural networks classifier. The system can be applied to many fields like education, offices, construction and sports. Extensive experimentation proved the validity of the proposed system.

AB  - The non-caloric sweeteners market is catching up with the market of conventionally used sugars due to the benefits of preventing obesity, tooth decay and other health problems. Developing strategies for designing easier-to-produce novel molecules with a sweet taste and less toxicity are up-to-date motivations for the food industry. In this sense, Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been reported as cutting-edge technologies to guide the design of new molecules towards specific objectives, including sweet taste. The largest known dataset of sweet molecules is here provided. The dataset contains fully integrated 9541 sweeteners and 1141 bitterants from FooDB, FlavorDB and literature. This robust dataset allowed the development of standard Machine and Deep Learning pipelines towards conceiving Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) between molecules and sweetness. In this work, we showcase that Textual Convolutional Neural Networks (TextCNN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) outperformed most of traditional “shallow” learning approaches. These Deep Learning (DL) models produced platforms to guide the design of new sweeteners and repurposing existing compounds. Sixty million compounds from PubChem were evaluated using these models. Herein, we deliver a dataset of 67724 compounds that present high probabilities of being sweet. Quick searches in literature allowed us to find 13 molecules reported as potent sweetening agents, revealing that our approach is suitable for finding new sweeteners, valuable to expand food chemistry databases, repurposing existing chemicals and designing novel molecules with a sweet taste.

AB  - Globally, cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death; According to estimates, it takes an average of nearly 18 million lives each year according to the surveys. Recent development in the medical industry can bring a good solution to this using machine learning predictions. Individuals may suffer from elevated overweight and obesity, blood sugar, blood lipids, blood pressure, and blood glucose as a result of behavioral risk factors. Here, this research work has developed a prediction model by applying an ensemble technique on KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The unique combination of these basic models with the bagging technique will create an improved model that will have an advantage over the current models in the quicker and more accurate prediction of cardiac problems, hence assisting the medical professionals. To detect the outliers and important features, Recursive Feature Elimination and Inter Quartile Range (IQR) methods are used. A web interface is used to collect user records to forecast cardiac disease.

AB  - Body Mass Index (BMI) is a commonly used measure of body fat based on an individual's height and weight. Public health authorities and organizations monitor BMI at a population level to assess the prevalence and trends of under-weight and obesity within communities. This helps identify at-risk populations, evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and develop targeted strategies to promote healthy weight and prevent associated health problems. However, there is a lack of BMI monitoring methods that do not require active cooperation or cause privacy concerns to human subjects. This paper introduces a BMI classification approach based on passive WiFi sensing. Our proposed approach is inspired by the observation that different body shapes cause dissimilar impacts on WiFi signal propagation, which can be reflected by Channel State Information (CSI) readings. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, we developed a BMI sensing system that classifies the BMI of human subjects when they move in a WiFi range. Our evaluation results show that our approach could be an effective tool for public-health-oriented BMI monitoring, yielding a precision rate of 70.86%, a recall rate of 71.21 %, and an F1 score of 73.66%.

AB  - Artificial intelligence techniques have been increasingly applied in healthcare to help in many areas, from assisting clinical diagnoses to preventing diseases. In this paper, a machine learning approach to predict cholesterol levels using non-invasive and easy-to-collect data is presented. Specifically, it uses clinical and anthropometric data gathered by nutritionists during weight loss intervention (dieting) periods. The prediction power analysis of different patient variables is aimed at improving both non-invasive diagnosis quality and screening of associated diseases. Moreover, a clustering analysis has been carried out to identify different groupings of patients that might share some characteristics that have so far remained inconspicuous but might contain a valuable diagnosis or prognosis information for clinical experts. The experiments show a mean absolute percentage error rate (MAPE) of 4.39% in cholesterol estimation via regression, as well as clustering of patients within four profiles in which variable values share commonalities among cluster members.

AB  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a significant contributor to infertility among women of reproductive age, along with other health conditions such as preterm abortions and anovulation, which impact the health of women worldwide. This endocrine condition, affecting 5-10% of women in their reproductive years, is characterized by irregular hormone levels, including an excess of male hormones. PCOS leads to ovarian dysfunction, increasing the risk of miscarriage and infertility. Additionally, PCOS symptoms include obesity, irregular menstrual cycles, acne, hirsutism, and various other manifestations. Therefore, diagnosing PCOS is challenging due to the diverse range of symptoms and the presence of several related gynecological disorders. Diagnosing PCOS requires many clinical tests and ovary scans, which can be time-consuming and costly for affected patients. Many of the existing models using Convolution Neural Network (CNN), for detecting PCOS reported moderate results in classifying PCOS and non-PCOS cases. However, further improvements in accuracy can be achieved by combining handcrafted features with CNN features. Therefore, this paper introduces an Expert System to Detect PCOS (ESDPCOS) that aims to accurately and efficiently classify PCOS and non-PCOS cases using ultrasound images. The system employs a hybrid approach, utilizing the CNN model for deep feature extraction and the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) technique for local feature extraction. Then the combined features are processed through a fully connected layer to detect PCOS. The proposed model has achieved an impressive accuracy of 96.06%.

AB  - Data mining techniques are commonly used into clinical decision support systems to gather and diagnose various medical conditions accurately. Clinical decision support systems play an important role in cardiovascular disease diagnosis, showing their crucial role in recognizing significant death rates associated with heart disease globally. Heart disease prediction systems primarily use clinical datasets from lab analyses, but often overlook crucial factors like age, family history, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, nicotine/liquor use, obesity, or sedentary lifestyle. A system built upon these risk factors serves as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, offering proactive indications of potential heart disease to patients. This proactive approach has reduced the need for hospital visits or expensive medical checkups. As a result, the current research presents a way for predicting heart disease by leveraging significant risk factors. This approach utilizes the highly effective fuzzy decision support system, a prominent tool in data mining, for enhancing risk stratification processes. The system uses patient age, blood pressure, blood cholesterol levels, and physical activity as input parameters to generate a single output giving the status of risk. This risk status is segmented into categories of varying severity, including "Not serious," "Serious," and "Very serious," facilitating determine risk assessment and stratification.

AB  - Social isolation is an objective absence or paucity of contacts and interactions between a person and a social network. Loneliness is a subjective feeling of being alone, separated, or apart from others. These two highly correlated mental health concerns significantly increase the elderly's risk of premature death from all causes, a risk that may rival those of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. In this work, we propose an integrated design for technology usage to tackle the aforementioned mental healthcare concerns involving the elderly community. The technology infrastructure is an Internet-of-Things (IoT) monitoring system aiming to detect social isolation and promptly predict the risk of loneliness. With our system, interventions can be developed to maintain the mental well-being of the elderly, a salient need due to the social disruptions incurred by COVID-19.

AB  - Smartwatches are becoming more popular for recognizing and monitoring human actions in everyday life. These wearable devices are equipped with various IMU sensors for ubiquitous data processing and recording of human physical activity data. Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has risen to the top of the list of the most active research topic due to its widely real-life applications in various practical domains, such as healthcare monitoring, sports and exercise tracking, and misbehavior prevention. Many machine learning and deep learning approaches have been recently proposed to solve the problem of human activity recognition, focusing on activities of daily living. However, an exciting and challenging HAR topic deals with more complex human activities such as eating-related activities. This paper proposes a sensor-based HAR framework using data from eating-related activities recorded by a smartwatch sensor. In this framework, five d eep learning networks (CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, Stacked LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-CNN) are evaluated for their recognition of eating-related activities. To ensure the model’s dependability, data from eating-related activities on the standard publicly available dataset WISDM-HARB are utilized to evaluate the proposed framework using state-of-the-art metrics: accuracy and confusion matrices. Experiment findings demonstrate that the S tacked LSTM model outperforms other deep learning models, achieving an accuracy of 97.37%.

AB  - Many individuals visit the emergency room due to severe discomfort caused by kidney stones. A kidney stone is a hard, solid particle of a substance that forms as a result of the minerals in the urine. They are the outcome of a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Obesity, certain foods, drugs, and a lack of water can all contribute to this illness. Kidney stones can be of various shapes and sizes. Numerous research and imaging modalities have detected the existence of kidney stones. To completely interpret and diagnose, these pictures require the knowledge of a medical specialist. Clinicians who use computer-aided diagnosis systems as supplemental tools gain considerably from the practical techniques provided by these systems. Nonetheless, the presence of noise has resulted in some errors in kidney stone classification. Machine learning (ML) has recently made remarkable progress, and this study suggests an automatic diagnosis of kidney stones based on coronal computed tomography scans (CT). For research, cross-sectional CT images were collected, yielding a total of 2600 images. Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and an ensemble (combination of the LR and RF) are used. The different metrics are used to compare the ML model for identifying the best model. From the metrics comparison, it is identified as all the positive metrics will be high for the ensemble method and negative metrics will be low for the LR model.

AB  - Human emotions play a key role in making decisions and solving problems in various situations in our daily lives. Poor mental health can reduce our body's immune power paving the way to mental health issues like depression, anxiety and stress. A healthy amount of stress may be motivating and useful, but excessive, continuing stress or a strong reaction to stress can cause obesity, heart attacks, type 2 diabetes, stomach pains, body aches, menstrual cycle disruption, meningitis, and other health problems. Due to this reason, it has become essential to perform periodic research on both the identification and prediction of emotional states. Wearables and other Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies for monitoring mental health might totally replace or supplement psychologists as technology advances. This study aims to predict valence and arousal in emotional dimensions space using different physiological biomarkers collected in K-EmoCon dataset through wearable sensors and compare the outcomes of several prediction models using supervised machine learning techniques. Two emotional dimensions were considered namely valence and arousal in predicting emotions on a continuous scale using various regression algorithms like Decision tree, Random Forest, Multi-Linear, polynomial, XG boost, Ridge, and lasso model. These models are used to find the relevance of biomarkers and their contribution to predict different emotional states through different metrics like R2 score, Mean square error (MSE), Mean absolute error (MAE), and Root mean squared error (RMSE). According to experimental outcomes, Random Forest regressor outperforms the other algorithms with an R2 score of 0.84 and MSE of 0.27 respectively.

AB  - This study applies and validates causal graphical models for the task of assessing the risk of a stroke given the stroke patient data. A probabilistic causal (Bayesian) network is designed to evaluate the risk factors identified by a stroke expert. Structural Equation Modeling is applied on empirical data to provide a quantitative assessment of causal relationships among the variables in the Bayesian Network, thus statistically validating the expert's knowledge. Several scenarios of risk assessment using the inference mechanism on the Bayesian network are demonstrated.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a chronic, long-term condition that significantly impacts public health and socioeconomic growth worldwide. It has been established that risk prediction models can benefit clinical management decisions by targeting patients at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This metric is critical for those at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus regarding healthcare and lifestyle changes. As a result, this study aims to uncover significant risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus classification. Another goal of this research is to discover the best prediction models by assessing the accuracy rate of each model. This study employs several classification models, includinglogistics regression, decision tree and naïve bayes. Moreover, several feature selection methods are employed in the classification model: forward selection, backward elimination and optimized selection (evolutionary). The analysis was conducted by using Diabetes BRFSS2015 dataset, which is obtained from Kaggle website. This dataset consists of 76902 observations with 20 explanatory variables and one target variable with dichotomous classification. The study's findings show that only eight of the 20 risk factors in the prediction models are identified as significant. Age, GenHlth, Sex, HvyAlcoholConsump, HighBP, HighChol, NoDocbcNoCost, and Veggies are all important riskfactors. Furthermore, among the nine prediction models, logistic regression with optimal selection had the highest accuracy rate of 75.61%. As a result, logistic regression with the optimum selection approach is the best model for predicting the prevalence of type 2 diabetes type. The study hopes to promote awareness and provide more insight into the risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes could be correctly predicted and recognised early, resulting in prompt, effective treatments and reduced consequences.

AB  - Dietary habits play a significant role in public health and well-being. Monitoring dietary activities is thus essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing many widespread diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. In this work, we present a low-cost wearable neckband for automatic diet activity monitoring. The $5 fabric-based device, comprising an electret microphone, a Bluetooth radio module, and a rechargeable Lithium-ion battery, can wirelessly transmit audio to a smart device in real-time. The classification algorithm processes the audio stream in 3s segments and extracts short-time spectral, waveform, and energy-based acoustic features. We compute various statistical functions from the acoustic features to obtain segmental feature vectors, which are subsequently used for machine learning. We perform an experimental evaluation using an in-house dataset collected using the neckband. We compare the performance of different classifiers in distinguishing between drinking, chewing solid foods, and other non-dietary activities. An averaged class-wise F-measure of 81.25% is achieved using the proposed wearable device and a Random Forest (RF) based classifier.

AB  - The SmartCHANGE project, a Horizon-Europe Research & Innovation project that has been ongoing since May 2023 and is scheduled to conclude in April 2027, aims to develop AI-driven decision-support tools to identify and reduce the long-term risk of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) in children and youth. NCDs have become a significant public health burden in developed countries, with common risk factors including obesity, low physical fitness, and unhealthy lifestyle habits. Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for establishing healthy habits, and early intervention can prevent or delay the onset of NCDs later in life. However, current tools for identifying high-risk individuals mainly focus on adults, leading to missed opportunities for early detection. The SmartCHANGE project aims to address this gap by creating trustworthy AI tools that accurately assess risk factors in children and youth and promote optimised strategies for risk reduction. The paper outlines the plan for the project from the project’s proposed methodologies, including dataset utilisation, data cleaning, risk prediction models (basic and complex), and the implementation of federated learning. Additionally, it discusses user experience aspects such as participatory design, suggested applications, and the evaluation of project outcomes.

AB  - At present, an increasingly large percentage of the global population merely adopts an unhealthy lifestyle. Due to this situation, most people are engaged in an unconscious relationship with overweight and obesity, closely linked to the rise of non-communicable diseases. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence-driven application to assist those afflicted with these disorders. On the other hand, it also encourages people to use this revolutionary solution by solving some practical problems with existing approaches. Although this seems to be a single solution, it is made up of combining four pieces namely Indirect BMR computation via visual cues, image-based ingredient identification for recipe with calorie intake tracking and supplements for unmet calorie needs, customizable exercise schedule and exercise analysis. All the solution's facets are brought together in a single mobile application based on artificial intelligence-related technologies. MoveNet, Mediapipe, Large language model (LLM), and ML Kit were used to perform the subtasks. The primary tasks were performed using custom-trained algorithms, including the Multiple Linear Regression model, Inception-ResNet-v2 model, and Random Forest algorithm, which were shown to be the most successful. Overall, the outcome of this research provides an all-in-one solution to reduce disease risks and guide people toward healthier lives.

AB  - The daily healthy diet and balanced intake of essential nutrients play an important role in modern lifestyle. The estimation of a meal's nutrient content is an integral component of significant diseases, such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Lately, there has been an increasing interest towards the development and utilization of smartphone applications with the aim of promoting healthy behaviours. The semi – automatic or automatic, precise and in real-time estimation of the nutrients of daily consumed meals is approached in relevant literature as a computer vision problem using food images which are taken via a user's smartphone. Herein, we present the state-of-the-art on automatic food recognition and food volume estimation methods starting from their basis, i.e., the food image databases. First, by methodically organizing the extracted information from the reviewed studies, this review study enables the comprehensive fair assessment of the methods and techniques applied for segmenting food images, classifying their food content and computing the food volume, associating their results with the characteristics of the used datasets. Second, by unbiasedly reporting the strengths and limitations of these methods and proposing pragmatic solutions to the latter, this review can inspire future directions in the field of dietary assessment systems.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) has become a common paradigm for various domains. More and more smart services are connected to the Internet by means of diverse intelligent edge devices. While people enjoy these convenient services, IoT service system will produce mass IoT data, which can be analyzed to improve service quality. In addition, these services usually coexist, which may lead to conflicts. Moreover, each user may have different kinds of needs. Suppose that in a smart home there are more than one person, a conflict may occur when they request the same service. We propose an intelligent hybrid system (IHS) to resolve IoT service conflicts, which consists of two steps, i.e., calculating historical preference mean and averaging on-site demand preferences. The first step is achieved by a weighted voting game (WVG) model, where machine learning is used to process historical IoT data and learn associated parameters. The second step is based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, where some residents’ contextual factors are considered. Based on the system, we have launched a series of experiments. Experiment results based on real data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in term of key accuracy metric, thereby validating our theoretical motivations and benefits.

AB  - In today’s fast-paced world, where late night eating and irregular eating patterns are common, chrononutrition offers a valuable approach on enhancing BMI (body mass index) and overall metabolic health. By aligning their eating habits with natural circadian rhythms and adopting effective strategies, individuals can potentially reduce the risk of obesity related issues and improve their overall health. Chrononutrition is an advanced area of research that examines the connection between the timing of food consumption and our bodies’ circadian rhythms. It has implications for overall health, including the BMI (body mass index) regulation. The timings and patterns of food consumption often are synchronized with the circadian rhythms and regulate a number of physiological processes. With studies indicating that a larger breakfast and a smaller dinner may help with weight management, recent research has revealed solid evidence associating meal timing to BMI regulation. Additionally, within the chrononutrition framework, intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating habits have emerged as promising approaches, suggesting potential advantages for weight loss and metabolism improvement. Chrononutrition affects insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular risk variables, and appetite regulation in addition to BMI, demonstrating its broader impact on metabolic health. This review paper explores the evolving intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and chrononutrition, a field focused on the temporal aspects of nutrition and their significant effects on human health. The use of AI technology to the subject of chrononutrition presents encouraging opportunities for personalized and data-driven dietary advice, as the significance of mealtime becomes increasingly important.

AB  - A frequent degenerative joint illness that damages the cartilage, the protective tissue that covers the ends of bones inside a joint, is osteoarthritis, sometimes known as OA. It can result in discomfort, stiffness, swelling, and a reduction in the range of motion in the joints that are afflicted. Osteoarthritis may affect any joint, including the hands, feet, and shoulders, although it most frequently affects weight-bearing joints like the knees, hips, and spine. Age, obesity, joint damage, repeated joint usage, genetic susceptibility, and other underlying medical issues such metabolic disorders are all risk factors for developing osteoarthritis. The categorization of osteoarthritis in this research is done using MobileNetV3 neural network architecture. In applications where computing resources are constrained, such as on mobile phones or other edge devices, MobileNetV3 is a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is created to be effective and suited for deployment on mobile devices. To effectively fight osteoarthritis in its beginning stages, it is important to first determine its type or category. Our MobileNetV3 model is very good at classifying osteoarthritis, achieving an accuracy rate of over 80%.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have a significant impact on increasing the mortality rate in the Middle East has one of the highest age-standardized death rates for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recently, based on the Assessment Risk Tools for Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD), World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 40% of all fatalities are attributed to cardiovascular diseases which has been linked to the main Risk Factors (RF) advances as obesity, hypertension, tobacco, and high cholesterol. In most of the cases, angiography is a reliable method for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is a costly approach associated with various complications. The significant increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and the subsequent complications and treatment costs have urged researchers to plan for the better examination, prevention, early detection, and effective treatment of these conditions. The present study aimed to determine the patterns of cardiovascular diseases using integrated classification techniques for analyzing the data of internal medicine patients who are at the risk of heart failure with 2621 samples and 40 characteristics. Selecting the characteristics and evaluating the influential factors are essential to the development of classifiers and increasing their accuracy. The proposed work suggested a model based on Gini-Entropy-Regression Model (GERM). The objective is to predict future risk with a certain probability and compared its performance with Deep Learning MLP Model. Statistical analysis and methods were used in this research to detect the symptoms that overlapped and to accurately identify a specific heart condition. The dataset utilized to train the computer consists of medical records from 14 hospitals which were collected based on four main categories such as basic information, symptoms, inducement and history, and physical sign and assistant examination. The suggested model consisted of four levels, level 1: Preprocessing data, Level 2: Feature Extraction, Level 3: Feature Selection, Level 4: Feature Detection. The results of the suggested model were as follows: the result was 84.4% when the symptoms of (CVD) is overlapping DSYP and CHEP. When Accuracy measured with combination DSYP, CHEP, and CYAN it has been increased up to 88.9%. DSYP, CHEP, CYAN, showing values of 89.8%. in 5th Neural Network (NN) the combinations were DSYP, CHEP, CYAN, DBPH, WFAT, EMPT showing ideal value of accuracy measured up to 90.6% and with Fever this combination of Neural Network has been showing accuracy = 91%. From the findings the previous seven predictors (Risk Factors) giving the best overlapping and diagnosis for CVD.
