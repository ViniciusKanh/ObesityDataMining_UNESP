AB  - Obesity has developed as a major global concern in the modern era due to the continuing trend towards unhealthy lifestyles characterized by excessive junk food consumption, insufficient sleep patterns, and prolonged periods of sedentary behavior. This research aims to predict the possibility of obesity using machine learning algorithms. We collected data from a total of 250 samples, which included moms and school-aged children of varied ages, as well as those affected by obesity and those who were not. Six well-ML learning techniques were used to study this. We used supervised machine learning techniques including RF, DT, GB, adaboost, catboost, and MLP to evaluate the suggested model. The results showed that combining the AdaBoost and MLP algorithms produced the best results, with 96% accuracy, 92% precision, 96% recall, and 94% F1. Using machine learning to analyze public health data can improve forecasts, find complicated patterns, and improve our understanding of issues such as identifying obesity risk factors.

AB  - Estimation for obesity levels is always an important topic in medical field since it can provide useful guidance for people that would like to lose weight or keep fit. The article tries to find a model that can predict obesity and provides people with the information of how to avoid overweight. To be more specific, this article applied dimension reduction to the data set to simplify the data and tried to Figure out a most decisive feature of obesity through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on the data set. The article also used some machine learning methods like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree to do prediction of obesity and wanted to find the major reason of obesity. In addition, the article uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to do prediction which has more powerful feature extraction ability to do this. Finally, the article found that family history of obesity is the most decisive feature, and it may because of obesity may be greatly affected by genes or the family eating diet may have great influence. And both ANN and Decision tree’s accuracy of prediction is higher than 90%.

AB  - The increasing overweight and obesity rates pose a significant risk to public health globally, as it is closely associated with various diseases and higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Prompt and effective intervention in the early stages is therefore crucial. Furthermore, identifying obesity risk factors is essential to combat the growing rates of several secondary health problems such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and other comorbidities. This study aims to unveil the key factors playing a remarkable role in shaping this situation, utilizing the immense potential of machine learning methods. The proposed pipeline implements feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The extracted subset of the original secondary dataset is then employed to train different state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, along with the proposed novel stacking ensemble model. The proposed model outperforms other models, achieving a noteworthy accuracy of 99.58% with an AUC score of 1.0, when combined with the SMOTE-ENN balancing technique. Additionally, model explainable tool SHAP is used to rank the features according to their individual contribution, providing a more in-depth explanation of how each feature impacts the model outcome. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and extensive datasets, this approach can significantly improve early-stage obesity prediction by uncovering its underlying causes.

AB  - One of the growing medical concerns globally is obesity. The age old popular notion for the disease lies in physical conditions (PC), and eating habits (EH), leading to much observed debate for the root cause of obesity. This study establishes the omnipotence of PC over EH as a leading cause of obesity. The dataset used for the study comprised of 16 features which were divided into two feature subsets (FSS); one FSS containing 9 PC features, and the other FSS containing features related to EH. Initially obesity was classified using the complete feature dataset, followed by classification using the PC and EH FSSs respectively. Eight Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used for the study. Regular performance metrics were used to evaluate the results. It was observed that the PC features unanimously contributed to obesity in contrast to EH features. Moreover, boosting was done using six algorithms, and results reflected that all the boosting algorithms enhanced the results. Of all the boosting algorithms, Hist-Gradient Boost generated the best results. The prime focus of the study is to analyze the major features for obesity using ML algorithms including boosting. This study computationally concludes that physical conditions have a greater impact on obesity with respect to eating habit conditions.

AB  - Automatic assessment of speech disorders is a cutting-edge topic in vocal analysis. Recent studies indicated possible connections between eating disorders and voice alterations. In this work, we assessed the influence of obesity and Gastro- Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) on voice, being the former a risk factor for the latter. Moreover, we investigated the mutual influence of the diseases working with a consistent set of features. To these aims, we used vocal tests from 92 subjects, with vocal tests consisting of vowel phonation and sentence repetition, and subjects including healthy controls, obese patients, patients with GERD, and obese patients with GERD. Machine Learning models, consisting of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine, were successfully employed on extracted features in binary classifications, resulting in 0.86 and 0.82 of accuracies on validation set in scoring the presence of GERD and obesity, respectively. The absence of performance deterioration when moving to the test set denoted a lack of overfitting. As for the tasks and the features employed, the sentence repetition proved to be more effective than the vowel phonation, while Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Perceptual Linear Prediction Coefficients, Bark Band Energy Coefficients, and noise measures appear to be among the most significant features for the application at hand.

We have hence conducted a study to determine how well three different machine learning algorithms can predict obesity in adults. Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and OneR are the algorithms used in this study. The different parameters we have used are Precision, F1 score, Accuracy, Recall and the Area under the operating curve (AUC) to compare them. They were used to assess how well the algorithms performed. In conclusion, when compared to the One-R and Naive Bayes algorithms, the Random Forest algorithm is the most accurate and trustworthy algorithm for predicting adult obesity. The findings of this study may aid medical practitioners in identifying people who are at risk of becoming obese and in establishing preventative strategies to lower the likelihood of obesity-related health issues.

AB  - More than 2.1 billion people worldwide are shuddering from overweightness or obesity, which represents approximately 30% of the world’s population. Obesity is a serious global health problem. By 2030, 41% of people will likely be overweight or obese, if the current trend continues. People who show indications of weight increase or obesity run the danger of contracting life-threatening conditions including type 2 diabetes, respiratory issues, heart disease, and stroke. Some intervention strategies, like regular exercise and a balanced diet, might be essential to preserving a healthy lifestyle. Thus, it is crucial to identify obesity as soon as feasible. We have collected data from sources like schools and colleges within our organization to create our dataset. A vast range of ages is considered and the BMI value is examined in order to determine the level of obesity. The dataset of people with normal BMI and those at risk has an inherent imbalance. The outcomes are collected and showcased via a website which also includes various preventive measures and calculators. The outcomes are promising, and clock an accuracy of about 90%.

AB  - In the realm of public health, predicting obesity levels through machine learning emerges as a crucial initiative. This study employs a dataset comprising 2111 instances and 17 features, encompassing diverse factors such as physical activity, eating habits, and lifestyle attributes. Consideration of various attributes or features is essential in obesity level prediction to capture the intricate and multifaceted nature of the condition. Numerous factors, such as food practices, physical activity, lifestyle decisions, and genetic predispositions, all have an impact on obesity. By incorporating a diverse set of attributes, machine learning models can discern complex patterns and relationships within the data, enabling a more comprehensive and accurate prediction of obesity levels. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, the predictive model achieved a notable accuracy of 97.2% with Multilayer Perceptron ANN Model, followed closely by Gradient Boosting classifiers at 96.2%. Such predictive accuracy is instrumental in developing targeted preventive strategies and timely interventions. Flask based web application has been implemented for real time prediction using MLP model. The obesity scenario in India, compounded by factors like suboptimal dietary habits and sedentary lifestyles, underscores the urgency of effective prediction models for early detection and tailored health interventions.

AB  - This paper describes the implementation of a comprehensive clinical decision support system (CDSS) for the risk factors prediction of comorbidities related to obesity and for the characterization of indirect connections between such comorbidities and non-communicable diseases. In particular, the direct correlation between obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular, and heart disease is analyzed by using machine learning (ML) predictive models, while the connection of the co-occurring disorders to the numerous additional non-communicable diseases is analyzed via a graph-based user interface. The CDSS here proposed is, therefore, structured with three main components: ML predictive models based on publicly available datasets, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) local and global model interpretation, and graph-based representation of non-communicable disease connections. Multiple ML models are presented for risk assessment and a comparison is carried out based on performance key performance indicators. The best-performing model for each disease was proved to be: the multi-layer perceptron for diabetes and heart disease, and extreme gradient boosting for cardiovascular disease. Comorbidities risk factor prediction and a XAI local model explanation is performed on significant case studies. In addition, XAI global model interpretation is given for the entire dataset providing insights on the features’ contribution to the models’ implementation. Moreover, the graph-based visualization of indirect disease co-occurrence is performed by filtering connections according to different relative risk factor thresholds. This interface can be exploited by healthcare professionals to obtain, according to the needs and the clinical approach, a global perspective on obesity and its associated pathologies prevention as well as long-term treatment and care provision.

AB  - Postprandial hyperglycemia (PPHG) is detrimental to health and increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, reduced eyesight, and life-threatening conditions like cancer. Detecting PPHG events before they occur can potentially help with providing early interventions. Prior research suggests that PPHG events can be predicted based on information about diet. However, such computational approaches (1) are data hungry requiring significant amounts of data for algorithm training; and (2) work as a black-box and lack interpretability, thus limiting the adoption of these technologies for use in clinical interventions. Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose, DietNudge1, a machine learning based framework that integrates multi-modal data about diet, insulin, and blood glucose to predict PPHG events before they occur. Using data from patients with diabetes, we demonstrate that our model can predict PPHG events with up to 90% classification accuracy and an average F1 score of 0.93. The proposed decision-tree-based approach also identifies modifiable factors that contribute to an impending PPHG event while providing personalized thresholds to prevent such events. Our results suggest that we can develop simple, yet effective, computational algorithms that can be used as preventative mechanisms for diabetes and obesity management.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a medical disorder characterized by a number of metabolic abnormalities, such as hypertension, obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. Improved cardiovascular disease-related health outcomes can be achieved with early MS risk prediction in middle-aged adults. To enable an early and accurate diagnosis, a multitude of machine learning algorithms have been developed to support the clinical diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. This work aimed to identify the optimal MS prediction model using the state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Using a dataset, we have implemented machine learning algorithms for the purpose of early diagnosis and prediction of MS. For MS prediction, feature selection strategies were combined with machine learning models such logistic regression, XGBoost, Adaboost, Random Forests, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Naïve Bayes. After analyzing the results of each classifier, it was revealed that the Adaboost, Catboost and Random Forest classifier had the greatest and most dependable accuracy of 83.5%, 82.3% and 83%.

AB  - In this era, everyone wants to be fit and healthy by maintaining proper diet plans. Fitness has become a major concern in the modern world. Body Mass Index (BMI) value has nowadays become the benchmark for deciding whether a person is obese or not, as obesity may lead to many health-related problems. Thus, BMI screens for weight categories i.e., obesity which may lead to health problems. This work aims to create an intelligent system which can give the accurate fitness level of a person based on his/her gender, height, and weight by calculating BMI. In this paper, Machine Learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boost algorithm are used to predict the status of obesity levels and have achieved accuracy of 97% by KNN, 96% by RF and 95% by DT. BMI index is used to predict the status of health of an individual. “BMI-prediction of health status” dataset from Kaggle is used for the implementation of the aforementioned models and achieved the highest accuracy of 97%.

AB  - Obesity is a global health concern associated with severe complications, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Its prevalence has seen a consistent rise, demanding early detection and intervention. The thermal imaging technique has recently been particularly promising in monitoring and early detection of obesity-related diseases. To enable research on obesity detection technology using thermal imaging, a high-quality dataset is essential. Currently, comprehensive thermogram datasets for obesity research are limited. Hence, creating an obesity thermogram dataset is critical to advancing our understanding of obesity and its treatment. In this article, we improved our previous dataset and present an open-access obesity thermogram dataset that supports the development of obesity detection systems. We describe the thermal image acquisition procedures, participant selection, room protocol configuration, and thermal camera setups. These thermal images undergo a pre-processing phase involving color mapping configuration and temperature scaling, ensuring their comparability and usability. The obesity thermogram dataset is made available for non-commercial research, fostering transparency and collaboration in the scientific community. Researchers and medical practitioners can access the dataset to train and test artificial intelligence-based obesity recognition algorithms, contributing to developing advanced medical technologies.

AB  - Obesity, a global public health concern, is escalating rapidly, especially in the Middle East, with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) witnessing one of the highest prevalence rates among adults and children. This multifactorial health issue is influenced by genetic, environmental, behavioral, and social factors. However, the challenge lies in the lack of comprehensive and representative data that encapsulates the diversity and complexity of the population, particularly in the UAE. This research paper presents a novel AI-driven approach to address the obesity problem in the UAE. The study employs state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques to generate local data that are realistic, diverse, and representative of the UAE population and the global obesity situation. The data is derived from four global datasets, two related to obesity and two related to diabetes. The paper also identifies key features and factors that influence obesity in the UAE using machine learning and feature extraction methods. A predictive model is built and evaluated using the local data and the best-performing classifier, the random forest classifier. Our study’s random forest classifier achieved a 94.83% accuracy when trained only on the global dataset. However, when fine-tuned on datasets synthesized with different augmentation methods, it showed better results: SMOTE excelled with 98.09% accuracy, TabGAN was close behind at 97.02%, and VAE lagged at 70.99%. Therefore, domain adaptation using the synthesized data confirmed the robustness of the generated data, with SMOTE and TabGAN outperforming the original dataset with accuracies of 98.09% and 97.22%, respectively.

AB  - The global prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity is a major concern due to its association with chronic diseases and long-term health risks. Artificial intelligence technology has been identified as a potential solution to accurately predict obesity rates and provide personalized feedback to adolescents. This study highlights the importance of early identification and prevention of obesity-related health issues. To develop effective algorithms for the prediction of obesity rates and provide personalized feedback, factors such as height, weight, waist circumference, calorie intake, physical activity levels, and other relevant health information must be taken into account. Therefore, by collecting health datasets from 321 adolescents who participated in Would You Do It! application, we proposed an adolescent obesity prediction system that provides personalized predictions and assists individuals in making informed health decisions. Our proposed deep learning framework, DeepHealthNet, effectively trains the model using data augmentation techniques, even when daily health data are limited, resulting in improved prediction accuracy (acc: 0.8842). Additionally, the study revealed variations in the prediction of the obesity rate between boys (acc: 0.9320) and girls (acc: 0.9163), allowing the identification of disparities and the determination of the optimal time to provide feedback. Statistical analysis revealed that the performance of the proposed deep learning framework was more statistically significant (p$< $0.001) compared to the other general models. The proposed system has the potential to effectively address childhood and adolescent obesity.

AB  - One of the causes of chronic disease is obesity, where obesity is a condition of someone who is overweight. The beyond-weight problems simplest befell in high-earnings nations; however, weight problems are growing dramatically in low-and middle-earnings countries. Based on this, obesity needs further investigation to suppress the increasing number of obese people. To predict obesity levels, we use a machine learning approach in this study. The dataset is a dataset on obesity levels in adults, so the method used is a classification method including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, SVM, and Stacking Ensemble. This study uses Cross Validation (CV) to reduce the possibility of bias in the accuracy of results. The Cross Validation used is k = 10, 20, and 30. The classification method is evaluated using Performance measures, including accuracy, precision, and recalls, to get the best approach. This research includes data exploration, pre-processing data, seeking accuracy and comparing each method, namely Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, and SVM with CV k = 10, 20, and 30, and looking for accuracy and comparing the results of the stacking ensemble method with its meta-models. The highest accuracy is the accuracy value of the ensemble stacking method with the Gradient Boosting meta-model. The accuracy value obtained is 97.87% with k= 20 and k =30. With the same data, this accuracy is higher than the random forest, which gets an accuracy value of 97.64% with k = 20.

AB  - In recent years, China's material standard of life has improved as a result of the country's economic growth, the number of obese people in China has roughly tripled in 15 years, with half of all adults overweight or obese. Obesity is a major independent risk factors for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, closely related to the occurrence of such as esophageal cancer development also. In order to deal with this “public health crisis”, many ingredient recommendation systems have been developed for cooking healthy diets. In order to improve their performance, this study presents IPFC, an innovative and intelligent prediction tool, to predict people's food preference for cooking, where they can give more targeted recommendations. Our strategy is based on a dataset gathered through a real-world questionnaire, in which the questions are about participants' eating and behavior habits and their basic information. We utilize data mining methods on such a dataset. During the assessment tests, machine learning models such as ANN, DT, RF, SVM, GBDT, LR, and NB are evaluated for their ability to classify the dataset into several classes. The experimental findings demonstrate that SVM achieves a relatively higher accuracy than other considered machine learning models, whici is 50.00% using the test set that consists of a small number of data collected by us.

AB  - Worldwide, people are struggling with obesity and metabolic syndrome. For successful preventative interventions, it is necessary to predict and evaluate the risk factors linked to these illnesses. For the purpose of determining the potential of metabolic syndrome and obesity, this research presents a new cloud-driven logistic regression paradigm. Using the power of the cloud, we mined a massive dataset that included a wide range of demographic and clinical details. The cloud platform was used to build logistic regression models that analyzed intricate relationships among variables using powerful machine learning methods. A thorough assessment of risk variables is made possible by the framework’s incorporation of data from many sources. Predicting the likelihood of obesity and metabolic syndrome was a strong suit of our cloud-based logistic regression methodology. Important factors, such as genetic susceptibility, lifestyle variables, and clinical biomarkers, were discovered by the model. The ability to efficiently handle parallel data sets on the cloud improved the model’s predictive powers and made it possible to analyze massive datasets. An efficient and scalable method for large-scale evaluation of obesity and metabolic syndrome risk is provided by the suggested framework. The model may be easily adjusted to new trends and changing datasets using cloud-driven analytics, allowing real-time updates and enhancements. This study provides a powerful instrument for risk assessment and focused preventative actions, which advances public health initiatives and personalized treatment.

AB  - Biomedical text classification requires having training examples labeled by clinical specialists, a process that can be costly. To address this problem, active learning incrementally selects a subset of the most informative unlabeled examples, samples that are then labeled and used to train a given classifier, seeking to reduce the number of labeled samples. Nonetheless, the other unlabeled examples are not used by active learning, but incorporating semi-supervised techniques that use unlabeled samples could improve the representativeness of the data and the discriminatory power of the classifiers. This work proposes a generic semi-supervised learning framework for improving active learning and reducing the number of labeled training examples in biomedical text classification. The proposed framework combines manually annotated training examples selected by active learning and pseudo-labels obtained from a trained classifier. To evaluate the proposed framework, three biomedical datasets with textual information on obesity and smoking habit were used across different classification algorithms. The classification results show that the proposed framework can reduce the number of training examples that are manually labeled by clinical specialists by a 10% without affecting the performance of the classifiers. This performance is attributable to the ability of the classifiers to correctly select and label the training examples. Clinical relevance— We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised learning framework to reduce manual labeling efforts of biomedical texts by clinical specialists for the training of classifiers.

AB  - Heart disease is contributing one of the leading reasons of death in the contemporary world. The three major danger signs for heart disease are smoking, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and 47% of all US citizens have at least one of these risk factors. In the field of clinical data analysis, predicting cardiovascular disease is a major difficulty. In this case, Machine learning (ML) can be important for taking decisions and predictions about heart disease based on personal key indicators (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol level, smoking, diabetic status, obesity, stroke, alcohol drinking) of heart disease. In this paper, we proposed six machine learning models using survey data of over 400k US residents from the year 2020. The six machine learning models-Xgboost, Adaboost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes have been compared in detail. Through the prediction model for heart disease, we achieved an improved performance level with an accuracy level of 91.57% for the prediction of heart diseases with the logistic regression model.

AB  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal disorder which is associated with diverse symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, obesity, acne issues, hirsutism, alopecia, and excess secretion of androgen in women. These symptoms may vary from patient to patient and therefore it is important to get it diagnosed at an early stage as it may lead to serious health conditions like heart diseases, diabetes, endometrial cancer etc. Diagnosis of PCOS is performed using physical examination, laboratory tests and ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound is used to detect follicles or immature eggs present inside an ovary. Ovaries with PCOS can be easily detected using ultrasound where trans vaginal ultrasound is considered to be the most efficient technique as it provides an internal view of the ovaries especially in patients suffering from obesity. The ultrasound report consist of details like number of follicles present, and size of ovaries, luminal thickness etc., Manual detection is costly, and lengthy and may be prone to physician's error due to shortage of health staff in developing countries like India and lead to higher false positive rates. Therefore, an automated system for PCOS segmentation and classification can help in escalating this task. This paper reviews existing state-of-the-art works where classification and segmentation have been used for automated detection of PCOS. Various machine learning, deep learning and transfer learning techniques are discussed. It was observed that this research field needs technological advancements through release of open-source datasets, and robust automatic pipelines for fruitful detection of PCOS in women.

AB  - The goal of this research is to comprehend correlation between the daily activities and mental health of the children which have been under discussion over the recent years. Children (age 12 to 17) who suffer due to mental health issues are often stressed and depressed and as a result are said to fall into unhealthy eating habits which in turn causes obesity and various other heart diseases. Thus, in this study we will be identifying the daily activities that has major contributions towards the condition of becoming overweight, obese and mentally ill by using historical and statistical data along with ensemble machine learning techniques. The extra trees algorithm will be used to find the important features and their scores in this study. Further, In the end we will draw conclusions by distinguishing the features based on their scores and by giving them labels in order to observe an insight on major and minor contributions towards conditions for children on a day-to-day basis. The findings of this study can also inform future research on the complex relationship between daily activities, mental health, and obesity. Ultimately, the study aims to shed light on the factors that contribute to the health and well-being of children, which can have significant long-term implications for their physical and mental health as they transition into adulthood.

AB  - Heart failure is common problem among the people. Many people suffer from this problem. Bad eating habits, BMI level, obesity, in active daily life are the things which are responsible for heart failure. Many data sets about patients are available which stores information about heart of the human being. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are applied for making prediction of various diseases in recent years. ML models are trained on data sets and then trained models are tested on the tested data sets. Cross validation is a new tool to improve ML. In this paper accuracy of five ML models is calculated with and without cross validation. From results it is observed that cross validation improves the accuracy of all five ML models. The Random Forest ML model is best for heart disease prediction with 92.86% accuracy.

AB  - Eating disorders do not have a single cause, so the prediction of suffering from them is a complex issue. The economic cost associated with the treatment of diseases and disabilities derived from overweight and obesity is expensive in relation to the cost of prevention. This research aims to evaluate analysis techniques to identify the relationship between obesity in Mexico and several factors (variables) such as habits and physical conditions, using information technologies. Artificial Intelligence is a resource that can help in complex multifactorial issues, such as the identification of risks in different fields or combination of them. Methodologically, the use of Mexican public databases and expert knowledge is proposed to feed the Artificial Intelligence system to achieve early prediction and/or diagnosis of obesity condition. Throughout the bibliographic reference, the benefit of the use of these technologies for predictive analysis in the health arena is identified, being an opportunity to make this technology available to many people showing the impacts and consequently, favoring prevention. It is demonstrated how the Random Forest model presents a better performance with respect to the other techniques for the classification problem presented.

AB  - This paper presents a novel Clinical Decision Support System based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI-CDSS) as a comprehensive structured tool consisting of three main parts: predictive models, XAI interpretation, and a graph-based visualization of non-communicable pathologies. Machine learning models are proposed to predict the risk factors related to the direct association between obesity and comorbidities such as cardiovascular, heart disease, and diabetes. Multilayer perceptron and extreme gradient boosting are chosen among different machine learning algorithms as the best performing for the risk factors prediction of the selected comorbidities. They perform prediction with an accuracy of 0.72 for diabetes, and 0.73 for cardiovascular and heart disease. The intuitive XAI interface gives the end-user insight into the machine learning decision process, while the graph visualization links such co-occurrent pathologies to many other non-communicable diseases and provides a global view to healthcare professionals, usable for obesity and associated pathologies prevention and long-term treatment and care.

AB  - Elderly people are an important age group in society that must be constantly under control. Because of old age, these people suffer from various diseases such as blood sugar, blood pressure, and obesity. If the elderly are not treated and their diseases are not controlled by taking medicine, it will cause headaches, dizziness, and blurred vision, which will cause problems for them as a result of these symptoms. One of the problems they cause is physical and mental injury. Physical injuries in the elderly population are caused by falls. Therefore, providing methods to prevent them from falling can play an important role in their physical and mental health as well as in improving their quality of life. Machine learning algorithms can predict the condition of the elderly at any moment. If an elderly person has acute symptoms, the risk of falling can be prevented by turning on the smart sensors. In this study, we propose a method for predicting falls in elderly individuals with diabetes using a multilayer perception classifier. According to these results, elderly people with diabetes are more prone to falls because of symptoms caused by blood sugar, such as dizziness and motor nerve disorders. By designing an intelligent system that can predict the condition of the elderly based on various diseases, it is possible to prevent them from falling. In this study, various factors collected from this dataset were examined. By reviewing the data and confirming the opinion of a cardiovascular disease specialist, the elderly with diabetes had more symptoms, such as headache, dizziness, and blurred vision, than the rest of the elderly; therefore, these symptoms lead to a drop in blood pressure and fall. The results obtained from the implementation of the machine learning algorithm showed that machine learning could predict the risk of falling in elderly patients with diabetes with a high performance (accuracy=97%).

AB  - Over the past three decades, an increase in overweight and obesity has devastated public health. A better diet and increased exercise are encouraged by approaches for reducing obesity (PA). Two significant public health problems contributing to the rise in chronic illnesses that cannot be prevented are obesity and physical inactivity. Obese people cannot perform the necessary level of physical activity due to their lack of physical fitness and comorbidities. The obesity paradox, early weight loss, maintenance, and the importance of physical activity and exercise training (PA-ET) for avoiding body weight increase are all covered in this study. This research blends machine learning algorithms and a data-driven methodology to identify patterns in profiles related to weight change in a nutrition intervention programme. This study builds a web-based weight loss reminder system using fuzzy logic that allows users to keep track of their weight, caloric consumption, and physical activity. Aerobic ET programmes advocated for public health can result in moderate weight loss; however, individual weight loss varies greatly. Doctors should emphasize that even if patients don't lose weight, they can still benefit from their physical activity programme and educate patients about reasonable expectations. PA programmes continue to have a lot of health advantages. Finally, evidence demonstrates that obesity is treatable and preventable. It is possible to maintain weight loss attained with diet and exercise. This framework's main goal is to discover different thresholds that are susceptible to the harmful effects of obesity on health, and it was able to do so with 93.4 per cent efficiency.

AB  - Direct methods for accurately measuring the volume of fat tissue in the human body are not suitable for use in epidemiological studies due to their lack of precision. Therefore, indirect methods, such as indices and formulas, are used to estimate the percentage of body fat (BF%) in patients. While the body mass index (BMI) is a commonly used method, it does not differentiate between adipose tissue and other tissues, and only provides a height-weight ratio. Recent studies have shown that machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs), can effectively evaluate anthropometric parameters to obtain BF%. Although the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for this purpose remains a possibility for future research.The objective of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of ANNs in classifying abnormal values of BF%. The ANNs were trained using a database consisting of 7750 subjects, ranging in age from 17 to 102 years, and including 27 predictive variables. To evaluate the ANNs the accuracy (ACC), specificity (SPE), sensibility (SEN), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and F1 were calculated. The results suggest that ANNs are more effective than SVMs in addressing classification impaired BF%, although the difference between the two methods is not significant when compared to previous work that used the same database. Notably, ANNs outperformed SVMs in their ability to classify true negative values, achieving a success rate of NPV of above 98% compared to 85% for SVMs. This finding is consistent with the results obtained for specificity, where ANNs achieved a rate of above 99% compared to 67% for SVMs. Additionally, all other metrics (ACC, SEN, SPE, PPV, and F1) yielded results above to 96%.

AB  - Stroke is a sudden interruption in the blood flow to a portion of the brain that can result in the loss of capacity to move certain parts of the body. In this work, all elements that impact this disease are studied, their influences are extracted using exploratory data analysis, and a model is constructed to forecast the disease's likely existence in a patient. Using under sampling and over sampling strategies, several data balancing techniques are used to increase model performance. As a consequence of the findings, a 98 percent accuracy rate has been achieved compared to earlier research. While the class distribution is severely skewed, there are relatively few examples of a class. This study reveals that over-sampling approaches yield better results than under-sampling ones. When sampling-based techniques are used instead of sampling-based approaches, the outcomes improve by 46%.

AB  - Diabetes is a disease that occurs when the blood glucose level or blood sugar level meets high values. The level of sugar is increased in the human body is due to several factors like obesity, physical inactivity, gender, age, family history, food habits, and so on. Based on these attributes and with the help of machine learning techniques one can foresee diabetes. According to the increasing morbidity, the number of patients who suffer from diabetes will reach 642 million in 2040, which indicates one of the ten adults in the world will suffer from diabetes. Algorithms that are used in Machine learning can apply in the various medical health field to detect and predict diseases. In this paper, we applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes in Diabetes 130-US hospitals for the years 1999-2008 Data Set and Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset. We made a comparative study of the accuracy of all machine learning algorithms. In our diabetic prediction model, we got a higher accuracy value for the random forest algorithm.

AB  - The Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most widespread health concern currently affecting women in the world. The defining characteristics of PCOS are cysts in the ovaries and a hormonal imbalance. One in every five women in India is affected by PCOS because of the lack of awareness in women. The late identification of PCOS can also lead to high risk diseases including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity etc. Thus, the main objective of the paper is to examine how some features like heart diseases, obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure can be used for diagnosing PCOS through hybrid and classification algorithms. In order to determine the best performing algorithm in this scenario, the comparison is made among the six simple classification algorithms based on the performance metrics. The algorithm which gives the highest accuracy is further used in conjunction to create hybrid algorithms. The performance metrics and time taken is compared among all simple classification and hybrid algorithms. The most efficient algorithm is then can be further used for PCOS diagnosis which in turn saves time and cost.

AB  - Recently, liver disease is emerging as one of the most common diseases with high fatality rate. The number of liver affected patients are steadily increasing due to various factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, inhalation of hazardous fumes, eating tainted food, pickles, and narcotics. Liver disease can also lead to a variety of serious illnesses, including liver cancer. To enhance the process of liver disease classification, a semi supervised machine learning algorithm has been presented in this research work. The use of liver patient datasets in the development of classification algorithms to predict liver disease is being investigated. The proposed study employs hybrid SVM and K-Means algorithm-based model to examine the entire patients’ liver disease. Chronic liver disease is defined as a liver ailment that exist for at least six months. As a result, the considered population will be classifiers as liver disease affected and non-affected people. The SVM classifiers are used to determine the number of liver disease affected individuals, and then the hybrid k means clustering method is used to determine how much of the liver has been affected. As a consequence, the output from the proposed hybrid K-Means clustering model reveals high prediction accuracy.

AB  - Health and performance monitoring technologies are commonly used by athletes. Obese people on the other hand benefit less from empowering technologies that address their specific needs. It would arguably have a substantial positive impact if such could promote a more active lifestyle. The consequential costs of obesity are a matter of great concern for health professionals and European policy makers alike. The EU-funded STop Obesity Project (STOP) addresses these shortcomings. Its main work results are a platform and a gamified app supporting people with obesity under professional supervision. STOP employs smart sensors and artificial intelligence in the form of a chatbot that teaches healthy nutrition and physical activity. Users interact with it through digital avatars on their smartphones while supervising health care professionals are presented with the results through an analytics pipeline. The platform is based on the Knowledge Management Ecosystem Portal (KM-EP) for data management, and visualisation. It fuses data from the app with streams from various vendors' wearable health trackers. All the while ethical concerns feature prominently in the design of STOP. A feasibility study with obese volunteers showed that STOP in fact can be used as intended. Moreover, participants in a separate usability study gave generally positive ratings for its user experience.

AB  - Pregnancy-related diabetes is dangerous. Some pregnant women get diabetes despite the risk factors of lifestyle, family, and location. Diabetes persists after delivery and requires lifestyle changes, but pregnant women have managed it by finding new ways to reduce side effects. The gynecologist will advise the couple on when they can get pregnant, the risks to the mother and child, and the risk factors for gestational diabetes. The SQU Medical Journal [1] reported high rates of gestational and pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM) in pregnant Omanis. Preventing or counseling women to change their lifestyles before getting pregnant would reduce the risk to the mother and fetus. This study used AI and deep neural networks to examine its effects on pregnant women. The dataset examined women's gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) patterns across age groups and locations. Deep and feed-forward neural network, machine learning algorithms detect obesity, overweight, family history of diabetes, and other variables like blood RH factors before and after pregnancy. We are focusing on the obstetric and perinatal outcomes of pregnant Omanis with gestational and pregestational diabetes, using machine learning to predict gestational diabetes (GDM) early. To assess blood glucose levels in pregnant women aged 21–45 during the second trimester, determine the age-related frequency of GDM, and examine promising risk variables for GDM. This research's experimental testbed includes Google Colab, Python, Keras, PyTorch, Anaconda (IDE), TensorFlow, and Gradio. This research reduces delivery complications and pregnancy misshapes in pregnant women with diabetic families in Oman.

AB  - One of the leading causes of death is CVD(Cardiovascular disease) which is communally referred to as heart disease. CVD is the summation of disorders that affect the heart's ability to function. Every year, over 18 million people worldwide die as a result of heart disease. One in three deaths from cardiovascular disease in them is preventable, and heart attacks can be predicted months in advance by assessing the patient's risk factors. Obesity, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, and Glucose levels are some of the risk factors. The aim is to predict CVD based on risk factors of patients, who are affected by their habits and patients' basic health information, using the Cardiovascular Disease Dataset from Kaggle using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms. Smoking and Alcohol consumption are some practices that will maximize the possibility of getting cardiovascular disorders, and doing workouts will reduce the risk of getting cardiovascular disease. In our work, we have implemented four models for predicting CVD namely Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Deep Learning Model and Random Forest. The DL model, with an accuracy of 73.78 %, outperformed the other three models.

AB  - Obesity is a pervasive and hazardous condition that affects a significant portion of the global population, including developed countries such as the United States, where it is considered an epidemic. On the other hand, malnutrition remains a prevalent issue in many underdeveloped and developing countries. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a valuable metric for monitoring these conditions; however, calculating an individual's BMI requires precise measurements of height and weight, which can be a cumbersome process. To streamline this process, it may be possible to predict an individual's BMI from their photograph. this study employs Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques to develop and evaluate different models for predicting BMI from photographs. The dataset was collected via web scraping, and data augmentation techniques were employed to increase its size due to its limited availability. In addition to the web-scraped dataset, clean images from a related study were also included to supplement the dataset. The images were then segmented using UNet to improve predictions. The use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques, coupled with data augmentation and segmentation, resulted in an accurate model for predicting BMI from photographs. The findings from this study have the potential to aid in the prevention and treatment of obesity and malnutrition on a global scale.

AB  - Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated based on the ratio between a person’s height and weight, is a widely used metric for body weight or fatness. In this paper, we investigate the potential of face image-based BMI estimation using an RGB camera. We proposed a simple yet highly reproducible image processing framework that converts an input face image into a BMI value or obesity class (underweight, normal and overweight). In this framework, we explored the options of using 2D or 3D facial landmark models, view angle correction in 2D and 3D, different choices for facial feature extraction (landmark distances or coordinates), and different prediction models (regression or classification) based on shallow machine learning techniques. Our framework was thoroughly validated on two public datasets. The insights of this measurement are discussed, as well as the challenges and limitations, to increase the understanding for future improvement of camera-based BMI estimation. The source code of this study is available at https://github.com/hxfj/Facial-Landmark-based-BMI-Analysis.git.Clinical relevance— This contributes to simpler and more effective daily health management.

AB  - Diabetes is considered to be one of the worst illnesses in the world. Diabetes is caused by a combination of variables, including obesity, excessive blood glucose levels, and other causes. It does this by altering the insulin hormone, which in turn causes an irregular metabolism in the crab and raises its blood sugar levels. This program’s primary objective is to lessen the risk that people may acquire diabetes by making forecasts for them and urging them to take more care of their diet and lifestyle in the years to come. The key goals of this research were to develop and execute a method for predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques, as well as investigate the strategies that would be used to achieve success in this Endeavour. The suggested technique makes use of a wide variety of classification and ensemble learning algorithms, some examples of which include Knn, Label Encoder, and train test split. The results of the research may provide information that will help medical professionals make more accurate early predictions and judgments in order to better manage diabetes and save lives. The method first extracts information from a dataset, such as certain symptoms that may be utilized to gain further knowledge about diabetes, and then validates that information using other data. This paper objective was to build classification models for the diabetes data set, develop models that can determine whether or not a person is sick, and get the greatest possible validation scores in the models that were developed. Massive datasets may be found in the healthcare business. By investigating enormous datasets in this manner, we may uncover previously unknown information and trends, which will enable us to draw conclusions based on the data and make accurate forecasts. We categorize the dataset using random techniques since our major goal in doing this research is to determine the method that is the most accurate for predicting diabetes. This will be accomplished by integrating machine learning, data visualization, and data interpretation. The use of machine learning, which is becoming more important in the modern healthcare sector, will be the focus of this research. Massive datasets may be found in the healthcare business.

AB  - Diabetes is now a frequent condition among people worldwide. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing daily across various age groups due to numerous factors. Factors contributing to the development of diabetes include infections caused by bacteria or viruses, existence of chemical contaminants in food, autoimmune responses, obesity, unhealthy dietary patterns, lifestyle changes, alterations in eating habits, and environmental pollution. Therefore, diagnosis of diabetes in elementary stage is essential for preserving an individual’s life. Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes, is a significant metabolic condition that significantly affects a person’s overall health and wellness. Diabetes causes elevated blood sugar levels. Improper management of diabetes increases the likelihood of heart attack, retinopathy leading to vision loss, skin problems, and other ailments. Presently, there are over a million individuals affected by this condition. Early diabetes detection can help to take necessary measures. In this research, we applied the Support Vector Machine algorithm, a machine learning method, to detect patterns and risk factors in a dataset related to diabetes. This approach aids in effectively categorizing patients as either diabetic or non-diabetic.

AB  - As reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the major cause of death for both sexes and members of most racial and ethnic groups. Cardiovascular disease claims one life in the United States every 34 seconds. The expense of medical services, medications, and lost productivity because of deaths from heart disease causes the United States to lose a significant amount of money each year. At least half of all Americans have one or more of the following three major risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other significant indicators are the presence of diabetes, obesity (high body mass index), a lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption. In recent times, the healthcare sector has discovered that machine learning is a practical and reliable decision-making tool. The latter tends to assist doctors in making informed decisions about the heart condition of a patient. It has become increasingly important to develop an effective early-stage cardiac disease prognosis using digital patient information to enhance clinical decision-making. This study intends to find the most accurate machine learning classifiers for these prognostic uses. To predict cardiac disease, several supervised machine-learning algorithms were used and compared in terms of accuracy and performance. The following methods were used in our research: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K Nearest Neighbor. The heart disease dataset from Kaggle has been used to validate this research. The latter was created using data from the 2020 United States national health status survey of more than 410,000 people, performed yearly by the centers for disease control and prevention.

AB  - In the US, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and CAD, also known as chronic heart disease (CHD), are major causes of death for people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds, regardless of gender. Cardiovascular disease claims the lives of someone every 33 seconds, which is a very high rate of occurrence. Particularly, coronary heart diseases are responsible for a significant percentage of these deaths—375,476 people in 2021 alone. Important risk factors for heart disease include smoking, and a host of other illnesses and lifestyle choices, including diabetes, obesity, poor eating habits, inactivity, and excessive alcohol use. In the process of creating effective screening tools and estimating the risk of CHD, machine learning (ML) approaches have gained popularity. Using a dataset from Kaggle, this work presents an ensemble machine learning model for CHD prediction with an accuracy of around 94.06%. The random forest algorithm, which has been trained using copious clinical and demographic data related to CHD patients, is the main working mechanism of the model. Through the use of an ensemble approach—which combines many machine learning techniques—the suggested model outperforms individual approaches in terms of prediction. This emphasizes how combining different machine learning techniques may improve accuracy. According to the study's conclusions, the ensemble model has potential as a useful tool for early CHD diagnosis and treatment, which would lessen the disease's effects on patients and healthcare systems. Keywords: Coronary heart disease (CHD), extra trees (ET), Support Vector Machine (SVM), ischemic heart disease (IHD), Machine Learning (ML).

AB  - PCOS, or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, is a frequent hormonal condition affecting women during their reproductive years. This disorder results in irregular and infrequent menstrual cycles, which can cause infertility and other related health issues. PCOS can present with various symptoms such as irregular periods, acne, obesity, and excessive hair growth, among others. However, some symptoms may not be visibly apparent and can only be detected through testing. This paper focuses on different techniques and algorithms and compares them to suggest which model is best suited to accurately classifying whether a woman has PCOS or not. The algorithms Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Ensemble Learning are applied on the basis of dimensionality reduction and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to datasets available on Kaggle. This dataset consists of 43 attributes for 541 women, among whom 177 have PCOS. Based on the accuracy, it was found that the XGBoost Classifier performed better than the other models and ended up giving an overall accuracy of 89.63% before applying PCA and that RFC and SVC performed similarly and better than the other models and ended up giving an overall accuracy of 91.11% after applying PCA and retaining 99% of its variance.

AB  - This research work develops and implements an integrated system using IoT technologies and machine learning algorithm to measure Body Mass Index (BMI) and perform health analytics in hospitals. Obesity, overweight, and chronic diseases are major public health issues. Healthcare workers need accurate and quick BMI readings to monitor weight status and health issues. To overcome these limitations, the proposed system uses IoT sensors to automate BMI evaluations and collect real-time health data. Wireless IoT devices interface with hospital information systems. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm analyzes BMI, physical activity, and vital sign data. It can identify and predict BMI values from data. SVM can predict BMI for customized weight loss recommendations. The proposed setup helps hospitals to automate BMI measuring, thus reducing medical staff burden and manual intervention. Real-time monitoring and analysis enable early identification and individualized treatment of obesity-related health concerns. IoT devices with the SVM algorithm enable data-driven decision-making, improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

AB  - Chronic diseases such as diabetes can have a devastating effect on a person's overall well-being. Diabetes is characterised by abnormally high blood glucose levels, which are the result of either impaired insulin secretion or impaired physiologic effects, or both. Many tissues, including the eyes, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, and nerves, can be permanently damaged or dysfunctional due to diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes are the two types of diabetes (T2D). Diabetics with type 1 diabetes tend to be younger people, with the majority of them being under the age of 30. Increased thirst and frequent urination are the most common symptoms, as are elevated blood glucose levels. Oral drugs alone are ineffective in treating this kind of diabetes, hence insulin therapy is essential. Middle-aged and older adults are more likely to develop type-2 diabetes, which is frequently linked to obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, arteriosclerosis, and other conditions. Implementing a machine learning model that can quickly uncover the principles for predicting diabetes mellitus in individuals depending on their health status is discussed in this research. There must be an IBM cloud deployment of the model before it can be utilised as an API in web app development. The User Interface will display the model's prediction.

AB  - Nowadays, chronic insomnia is a critical problem of homo-sapiens. An increase in workload and tension in life led to the development of sleep stress. Sleep stress can damage human beings in a physical, psychological, and social manner. Sickness in the stomach, tension, and frayed nerves while sleeping are the most frequent symptoms of sleep stress. Sleep stress can lead to cardiac infarction, depression, senile psychosis, gastrointestinal problems, diabetes, obesity, and emphysematous. This paper primarily focuses on the classification of sleep stress levels using standard machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Radial basis function Supported-Vector Classifier (RBF-SVC), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Linear Support-Vector Classifier (L-SVC), Naive Bayes (NB), Support-Vector Classifier (SVC), on the scaled dataset using Standard Scaling. LR, KNN, and SVC outperformed all the other machine learning classifiers in terms of performance metrics.

AB  - Due to a shift in lifestyle, many young people are currently suffering from heart attacks, diabetes, and obesity. Because of work schedules, the sickness rate has grown since the covid epidemic. To stop this issue, early discovery is necessary. As a result, the constructed model will forecast the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart attacks based on user input from their respective location. An individual's health risk assessment is very important in determining any health conditions that require urgent care. This makes it possible for someone to recognize potential health dangers and take the appropriate safety precautions. Thus, the goal of this proposed system is to develop a user-friendly Artificial Intelligence driven health risk assessment application that would give users a platform to do basic health risk assessments. Based on the user input, Machine Learning based health predictors generate the health analysis report and alert the user with proper guidance. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, Voting Ensemble and Decision Tree algorithms are used for accurate prediction of disease. The proposed application is cost effective since it uses a couple of features.

AB  - The prevalence of heart diseases is rising quickly throughout the world, which has an impact on both the world economy and public health. According to the recent statistical survey reports, the increasing mortality rate is due to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, the use of tobacco, obesity, and an inconsistent pulse rate. It is difficult and time-consuming to investigate the various variations of these factors and their impact on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Therefore, it is necessary to use modern approaches to diagnose the disease early and minimize the mortality rate. The fields of machine learning and data mining have a wide research dimension and various novel techniques that could help in the prediction of CAD in its early stages and identify their patterns and behaviors in a huge amount of data. The results of such predictions will aid the clinical staff in decision making and early diagnosis. In such a scenario, we proposed a quantum version of the Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCQ-CNN) for Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) classification. The proposed model evaluates the quantum circuit-based technique that was inspired by convolutional neural networks, a very successful machine learning model. This method provides  $O(log (n))$  depth for  $n$  qubits, reducing the number of parameters and allowing for effective training and testing of real quantum devices. The model has been evaluated by considering the IHD dataset after the data has been cleaned and filtered through the Maximally Relevant Minimally Redundancy (MRMR) filter. For dimension reduction, a Support Vector Machine along with Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) has been considered. Initially, the model is tested with 20% of the whole dataset and gets the promising results of a testing accuracy of 84.6% with a testing loss of 0.28. By taking into account the same optimal parameters, the proposed model outcomes are compared to those of the classical Optimized Convolution Neural Network (Optimized-CNN) and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) models. Comparing the model’s competency to that of earlier published quantum models yields improvements in accuracy of 8.6%, 12.6%, 3.5%, and 1.8% respectively.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which is mostly related to conditions like obesity and diabetes, is a significant cause of death and suffering in the modern day. As of 2017, the global prevalence of CKD reached a staggering 843.6 million individuals. Prompt identification of CKD stages holds paramount importance in mitigating potential complications including hypertension, anemia, and neurological disorders. Leveraging the power of machine learning, early detection of CKD is pursued, predominantly through binary and multiclass classification approaches. The repertoire of utilized models encompasses XgBoost, Ada Boosting, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Extra Tree Classifier. To foster a comprehensive understanding of the data and prepare features effectively, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and label encoding techniques are harnessed. Ada Boosting, with recursive feature elimination, outperforms other models like RF, XgBoosting, Extra Tree Classifier, and DT. The study's emphasis is on accurate stage prediction in CKD diagnosis. This research contributes to advancing precise CKD stage prediction methods. The findings highlight Ada Boosting's effectiveness in enhancing CKD diagnostic capabilities.

AB  - Nowadays, people are increasingly concerned for their health as being healthy is regarded as a profitable investment. Obesity is one of the most common health problems that leads to multiple diseases. We work with the team that developed a mobile application to encourage users to change their eating and activity behaviors to improve their health based on a virtual competition platform. Participants are required to upload a weight-in photo to verify their weight before the challenge. Manually verifying these images can be time-consuming and error-prone due to the large number of images in each competition. In this study, we proposed an image classification approach to help screen incorrect images of the weight-in photo for the virtual competition. The image augmentation techniques were applied to the training images before being input into the classification model. Since the goal is to deploy the model in a mobile application, the suitable model must be small and efficient enough for use in a limited resources environment. Therefore, VGGNet-16 and MobileNet-V2 were selected as the classification models. The experimental results show that the model could learn from the preprocessed images and obtain satisfactory classification results from pre-trained VGGNet-16 with the highest accuracy and F1-score of 95.00% and 95.23%, respectively. MobileNet-V2 inference time was approximately 10 times faster but the performance was lower with the highest accuracy and F1-score of 93.00% and 93.32%, respectively.

AB  - Predicting cardiac conditions enables healthcare professionals to judge patients' well-being precisely. Machine learning, in particular, utilizes widely adopted algorithms and techniques that prove highly effective in diagnosing heart disease within a shorter timeframe. Nevertheless, predicting heart disease poses a challenging endeavor. The expanding volume of medical datasets has added complexity for healthcare professionals in comprehending intricate feature relationships and making accurate disease predictions. Consequently, machine learning (ML) is a viable approach for mitigating and comprehending symptoms associated with heart ailments. For our preliminary exploration, we've focused on the scenario of cardiac disease, aiming to delve into the methods in as much depth as possible. This paper delves into the ambiguity surrounding the implementation of machine learning techniques, including but not limited to conventional algorithms such as logistic regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes; ensemble learning methods like Random Forest and Decision Tree; and deep learning approaches, exemplified by the Feed-forward Neural Network. The data utilized in this analysis was sourced from Kaggle. The dataset comprises 13 attributes, including the class label. Our findings involve examining the disparities in models developed to achieve maximum accuracy, with logistic regression yielding an impressive 92.31%, surpassing other machine learning methods and academic research similarly. The findings demonstrate that the algorithm has the potential to offer a robust healthcare monitoring system for the early detection of heart-related conditions. Hence, initiating early intervention makes it possible to avert fatalities resulting from delayed diagnoses of heart disease.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is a major health concern worldwide, with an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year. It encompasses a range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. These diseases are often associated with a range of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, and genetic predisposition. Data analysis and machine learning have emerged as powerful tools for predicting and preventing cardiovascular disease. By analysing large and complex datasets of medical records, researchers can identify patterns and risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. Machine learning models can help identify important features in the data that are predictive of heart disease outcomes, and can be used to develop accurate and reliable predictive models. Moreover, data analysis can help identify disparities and biases in cardiovascular disease outcomes across different populations and regions. This research aims to develop a machine-learning model for predicting cardiovascular disease risk using benchmark datasets. Various imputation techniques, including Mean, Median, Most Frequent, KNNI, and the proposed risk prediction model, are compared in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The CatBoost classification algorithm is used for developing the proposed model, achieving an accuracy of 91% for the Hungarian dataset. This research provides valuable insights into the use of machine learning and data analysis for predicting cardiovascular disease and improving healthcare outcomes.

AB  - COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus and increasing in cases every day. This is because the large number of patients makes it difficult to be treated at the hospital. This is behind the need for survival prediction of COVID-19 patients within 48 days so that the medical team can prioritize patients who are predicted to not survive on that period. In this research, the firefly algorithm is used which aims to select attributes and will perform comparisons for data that is balance or imbalance and combined with data that do feature selection and does not feature selection. The data that will be used are age, asthma, diabetes, gender, COPD, pregnancy, hypertension, obesity, ICU, chronic kidney disease, smoking, heart disease, immune deficiency, pneumonia, and other medical history. In this research, the selected attributes were gender, type of patient, intubation, pneumonia, age, pregnancy, diabetes, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), asthma, hypertension, other diseases, obesity, chronic kidney disease, smokers, contact with COVID patients, and ICU. The prediction model with the highest level of performance is a model with balanced data with a recall value of 0.79, then a precision value of 0.93, then an f score of 0.85, then an accuracy value of 0.86, then a specificity 0,93, then a NPV 0,82 and a geometric mean value of 0.87

AB  - In recent years, diabetes has emerged as a highly significant global health concern, with a rapid increase in prevalence. It is projected that the number of people affected by diabetes will continue to rise, reaching 366 million by the year 2030, compared to 171 million in 2000. This study focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict diabetes in patients with fatty liver disease. Four different machine learning classifiers, namely K-Nearest Neighbor, Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network, are employed to detect non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and predict diabetes. The analysis is performed on a genuine dataset obtained from Al-Kasr Al-Aini Hospital in Egypt, and the model’s performance is evaluated using four-fold cross-validation. By comparing various machine learning algorithms, the study demonstrates that the Support Vector Machine classifier is particularly effective in identifying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, achieving an accuracy rate of 95.8%. Furthermore, the Artificial Neural Network technique is employed to predict diabetic patients, yielding a model performance result of 86.6%. This research underscores the potential of machine learning techniques in healthcare for early prediction of chronic diseases and supporting decision-making processes.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are increasingly becoming a silent killer with over 17.9 million deaths annually due to ischaemic heart disease and strokes. Additionally, that number is set to rise at a rapid pace as obesity rates and unhealthy eating habits increase worldwide. Cardiovascular diseases are quite well hidden among individuals and mostly remain undetected until they strike, with a high fatality rate. An active testing protocol must be established to ensure that all such problems are detected and mitigated at an earlier stage in order to improve the quality of life and life expectancy of individuals suffering from cardiovascular diseases.This generates a large patient dataset, and to accurately prepare models to handle the automated detection, they have to be trained on an existing data set which was chosen to a combination of 4 existing data sets from the USA, Hungary, and Switzerland, where each has 13 features and 1 target class which needs to be accurately analyzed and predicted to ensure that large scale checkups can occur without burdening the healthcare system. In the present study, the authors have worked to perform a series of exploratory data analysis, and base line predictions via 15 varying Machine Learning models to understand the type of models that perform better and can be utilized for further optimization.

AB  - Many organizations in this competitive world use data analysis to provide useful insights for decision making and problem solving tasks that exist in real - time scenarios. To preserve the information provided, technological improvements are needed to handle data privacy in the system. In real-world circumstances, large amounts of data will be collected from a variety of sources and need to be analyzed and protected from unauthorized access. As a result, machine learning models must be deployed across all sites without the need to upload data, as this could compromise privacy. Federated learning helps to provide this privacy for the data. In this paper, we have analyzed two methods of building machine learning models - the centralized or conventional method of building machine learning models and the federated approach of building models. The performance metrics in terms of accuracy has been examined. The results are used to highlight the improved accuracy of federated approach compared to the centralized approach without compromising the privacy of the data.

AB  - Even if people are rushing to go to work and have a hectic schedule, they are taking good care of themselves till symptoms appear. Obesity and weight increment are two attributes that affect working on the personal satisfaction across the world. The Internet of Things (IoT), which interconnects, distinguishes, recognizes, and processes information between gadgets or administrations, assumes a basic part in accomplishing the common objective. The Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare gives us the ability to track, analyses, diagnose, and manage various overweight and obesity diseases. Also, provide weight-loss and obesity prevention solutions. Because there are a limited number of items that may be employed in IoT, another technology, such as machine learning, is being presented to achieve the above-mentioned benefits. People who are at high risk for cardiovascular illness may also be at risk for renal disease, which can be diagnosed and treated using medical information from the past. However, CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) is a condition that has no analytic signs and is challenging to find, distinguish, and forestall, and it can forever hurt the wellbeing framework, along these lines AI is being utilized to track down it monastery for therapy forecast and examination. The principal objective of this examination is to foster a prescient model for CKD and coronary illness information utilizing open source Python modules. Machine learning algorithms can be used for prediction, and exactness is determined by comparing various algorithms including such K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as well as Fast-Recurrent Neural Networks (FRNN). This method is used to forecast a dataset derived from a patient's medical history. The expected number lets us know whether an individual will foster persistent kidney illness or simply not in view of the amount of potassium in their blood.

AB  - Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows for a neural network model to simultaneously train and predict on multiple related tasks/targets using a shared core network and task-specific branching layers. The related nature of the tasks can be exploited by MTL to regularize the model and its use has been shown to increase performance in all tasks. Imbalanced complexity in tasks leads to MTL models being dominated by a few tasks, which cause conflicting loss function parameters and poor training, resulting in generalized but unspecific models. Medical healthcare records (MHRs) taken on events such as pregnancy often track multiple related targets such maternal morbidity factors (i.e., Sudden Maternal Morbidity, Hemorrhage, Preeclampsia) and long-term health outcomes (i.e., cardiovascular disease, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, post-partum depression, substance use), which serve as an excellent testbed for the MTL models. This study seeks to develop solutions to task imbalance and interference for MTL systems and demonstrate their efficacy compared to traditional single-task models on a prenatal MHR dataset.

AB  - The pandemic of diabetes mellitus has spread to both industrialized and developing nations. In India, there will likely be 100 million people with diabetes by the year 2030. Due to genetic predisposition, a poor lifestyle that leads to obesity, decreased Insulin resistance, and adverse consequences brought on by urbanization, diabetes is the most prevalent kind of disease in adults between the ages of 41 and 60. Lack of understanding about diabetes has a number of harmful effects on health, so raising awareness of the disease is essential. A diabetes prediction portal has been created as a solution to this issue, and it is used to produce a dichotomous result. Machine learning is utilized to train the data on the PIMA Indians diabetes dataset, and k nearest neighbours produced the maximum accuracy.

AB  - Mild asthma symptoms can be easily mistaken for those of other health conditions, e.g., allergy and obesity-related symptoms. This might lead to delayed diagnosis and wrong treatment, risking complications and even permanent lung damage. In this study, we introduce a pioneering method for asthma detection. By integrating machine learning (ML) algorithms and advanced audio analysis techniques, the proposed method rapidly and accurately detects asthmatic patients from audio clips containing vocal recordings without the need for dedicated medical devices. By utilising various ML algorithms, the examination of audio clips analyses diverse asthma-related airflow control and respiratory aspects. To strengthen the reliability and accuracy of the model, feature selection algorithms are integrated into the proposed method to address overfitting concerns and retain the most informative features. The model evaluation employs various performance metrics, e.g., accuracy and confusion matrix, to ensure a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of asthma detection. Another novelty of the proposed method is the inclusion of established data analytics tools, e.g., Spotfire, H2O and Sklearn. This approach marks a paradigm shift compared to existing methods, which results in a simplified and more effective asthma detection method. Examining the overall results, vowel pronunciation with its full set of 14 features using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm on the H2O tool yielded the highest accuracy of 92%. Moreover, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) with correlation-based feature selection (CFS) and customised hyperparameters yielded accuracy of 85% respectively. The proposed method contributes to the advancement of ML theory in healthcare applications, providing a practical framework for the implementation of asthma detection while demonstrating superior performance compared to existing.

AB  - Diabetes affects a large number of people in modern culture. Individuals must keep track of food calories and total calories consumed daily to maintain a balanced diet. Type 2 diabetes is a devastating metabolic illness that may manifest in many symptoms and complications throughout the body. In the modern day, diabetics may be found throughout all age groups in society. The increased number of reported diabetes patients may be attributed to different causes, including but not limited to harmful or chemical components blended into the food, obesity, working culture and improper diet plan, atypical lifestyle, consuming food habits, and environmental variables. As a result, saving human life requires a proper diagnosis of diabetes. When used in the healthcare industry, machine learning techniques may help doctors foresee the onset of diabetes and other complications. This research proposes the Diabetic Food Recommendation System (DFR-HL) to identify diabetes and advice patients on managing their condition via diet (DFRS). The datasets are normalized using a standard scalar with an improved Decision Tree (IDT), and the feature is selected using a Random forest. Finally, the classification has been done with Hybrid (CNN with Resnet50) DL algorithms. The experimental results are compared with performance metrics.

AB  - Social presence has been known to impact eating behavior among people with obesity; however, the dual study of eating behavior and social presence in real-world settings is challenging due to the inability to reliably confirm the co-occurrence of these important factors. High-resolution video cameras can detect timing while providing visual confirmation of behavior; however, their potential to capture all-day behavior is limited by short battery lifetime and lack of autonomy in detection. Low-resolution infrared (IR) sensors have shown promise in automating human behavior detection; however, it is unknown if IR sensors contribute to behavior detection when combined with RGB cameras. To address these challenges, we designed and deployed a low-power, and low-resolution RGB video camera, in conjunction with a low-resolution IR sensor, to test a learned model's ability to detect eating and social presence. We evaluated our system in the wild with 10 participants with obesity; our models displayed slight improvement when detecting eating (5%) and significant improvement when detecting social presence (44%) compared with using a video-only approach. We analyzed device failure scenarios and their implications for future wearable camera design and machine learning pipelines. Lastly, we provide guidance for future studies using low-cost RGB and IR sensors to validate human behavior with context.

Through food image recognition and classification, dietary evaluation is conducted to achieve the goal of healthy eating. Manual features and classification methods in traditional target detection algorithms can no longer meet the requirements of detection accuracy and speed, so it is necessary to introduce depth learning-based techniques into food image recognition. Deep learning is a complex machine learning algorithm that allows computers to simulate the human brain's thinking, judge new problems through data sets (human experience), and improve themselves to obtain relatively accurate models, just like humans. Among them, convolutional neural networks have developed most rapidly. They are applied to image recognition with the expectation of being able to automate recognition through machine learning, thereby reducing the workload of image recognition and providing more objective analysis results. Deep learning has achieved great success in intelligent image processing, image classification, and recognition and has excellent development potential and social value. This article implements automatic recognition of food images based on the recognition algorithm of the YOLOv5 convolutional neural network structure, which can detect food images with high detection efficiency. It explores the combination of deep learning to identify food images, providing a reference for people to eat healthily, especially for obese people to control calorie intake, and providing theoretical support for food image recognition.

AB  - Liver disease has caused a serious concern in India and is rising similar to diabetes, about 3.17% of Indians die due to this disease. It is always a tedious task to identify liver disease in the initial stages, which may lead to life-threatening diseases such as liver cirrhosis, cancer, etc. The main reasons behind it are alcoholism, obesity, hepatitis B and C, etc. Therefore, there is a need for enabling automatic detection in the early stages which in turn leads to diminishing the death rates. This study proposes novel machine learning and neural network models to unfold this problem. Here, the Indian Liver Patient Dataset, a UCI repository with 583 samples is used. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)and Machine Learning (ML)models such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine are applied along with hyperparameter tuning to get the best model for accurate liver disease prediction. F1-score, accuracy, recall and precision with and without feature selection are analyzed. In this study, the F1-score of LR is the highest at 83.85% when no feature selection is applied. ANN and SVM topped 83.38% with the F1-score exhibiting the highest accuracy of 73.57%.

AB  - Modern people’s hectic schedules are a direct result of the ways they live and the responsibilities they have at work. On the other hand, maintaining a healthy lifestyle demands consistent physical exertion. Obesity is a result of people not paying attention to what they eat. As a result of modern living, obesity is on the rise. As a result, in order to maintain a healthy weight, people pick their food and exercise habits accordingly. People should know how many calories they consume and how many calories they burn. Calorie counts are easy to get online or on product labels, so it’s not hard to keep track of one’s calorie intake. There aren’t many tools available to help you keep track of the calories you burn. To keep up with the hectic pace of modern life and the constant search for shortcuts, we built a system that uses machine learning to track post-workout calorie burn and development. By taking a few attributes as input, this system can approximate the calories burned, which will show daily growth and motivate people to exercise more. This paper presents an innovative ML model for accurate calorie prediction; it’s called the Improved Learning Model for Calorie Prediction (ILMCP). To test how well it works, the authors cross-validate it with the traditional Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. As a result, it is the quickest approach and may be utilized for object identification in real-time. Next, we’ll apply the ILMCP algorithm to the picture for segmentation. Foreground extraction with little to no user input requires it. Following picture segmentation, we use the probing object’s known volume to determine the food item’s volume. Once the volume has been determined, the food item’s mass may be determined using formulae. Then, the connection between weight and calories can be used to compute the food item’s calories.
